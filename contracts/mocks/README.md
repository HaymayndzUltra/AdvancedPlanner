# Mocks and Stubs

This directory contains API mock routes aligned to `contracts/api/openapi-v1.yaml`.

Usage options:
- Import into a mock server (e.g., Prism, Mockoon) to simulate endpoints.
- Use in contract tests to validate clients against expected shapes.

Files:
- `openapi-v1-mock.json` â€” route list and example payloads for v1 endpoints.
