# Release Retrospective — 2025-09-03

## Scope
- Service: payments
- Environment: production
- Release window: 2025-09-02 → 2025-09-03
- Deployment markers: `deployment_marker_total{service="payments",environment="production"}`

## What Went Well
- SLO monitoring active with multiwindow burn alerts.
- MTTA 3m; MTTR 18m for two minor error spikes.
- Dashboard golden signals provided actionable visibility during rollout.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Warning alert fired twice without user impact (threshold slightly low).
- Runbook needed clearer rollback validation steps.

## Action Items
- Owner: team-payments — Adjust warn thresholds (+10–20%) by 2025-09-06.
- Owner: obs-platform — Add deployment annotation panel to service dashboard by 2025-09-05.
- Owner: release — Ensure deployment pipeline emits `deployment_marker_total` on successful prod deploy by 2025-09-05.
