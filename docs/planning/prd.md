## Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Agent-Orchestrated Delivery Platform (AODP)

### 1. Overview
The Agent-Orchestrated Delivery Platform (AODP) coordinates background agents across ten delivery frameworks (Discovery → Observability) to accelerate high-quality software delivery. This PRD defines the MVP scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, KPIs, dependencies, and constraints to enable parallel execution per the Master Planner recommendations (Strategy B: Swarm with Guardrails).

### 2. Goals
- Enable fast parallel execution across frameworks with contract-first integration and nightly merge trains.
- Establish clear handoffs between Planning, UX, Architecture/API, Implementation, QA, Security, Release, and Observability.
- Deliver a prioritized MVP backlog with measurable outcomes tied to KPIs.

### 3. Non-Goals
- Building advanced ML models or analytics beyond basic delivery KPIs in MVP.
- Full enterprise policy automation beyond baseline CI security gates.
- Comprehensive multi-tenant RBAC; MVP focuses on a single project context.

### 4. KPIs (Measurable Outcomes)
- DORA metrics: Lead time to change ≤ 7 days (P50), Change failure rate < 15%.
- CI health: Contract/CI pipeline pass rate ≥ 95% on main and integration branches.
- Test coverage: Unit+integration coverage ≥ 80% for MVP services.
- MTTR: < 1 business day for P1 issues (staging), < 4 hours for P0 (production) post-GA.
- Accessibility (UX): WCAG 2.2 AA for MVP UI components.

### 5. Users & Use Cases (Representative)
- Product/Program: Define scope, view roadmap, track milestone burndown and risks.
- Engineers (FE/BE): Consume API contracts, implement slices, run tests, ship increments.
- QA/Security: Gate merges via contract, e2e, and policy checks; report defects.
- SRE/Release: Orchestrate merge trains, deploy artifacts, monitor SLO/SLI dashboards.

### 6. MVP Scope
- Integration branch with nightly merge train and contract test suite gating merges.
- Baseline platform contracts: design tokens (UX), OpenAPI/GraphQL spec (Architecture).
- One vertical slice (“Onboarding”) spanning FE/BE with stubbed data and real contract tests.
- CI/CD pipelines with artifact signing, SBOM generation, and basic canary to staging.
- Telemetry: request metrics, logs, tracing hooks for MVP services; dashboards for SLOs.

Out of Scope for MVP:
- Multi-slice advanced workflows (e.g., Billing, Reporting) beyond Onboarding.
- Full role management and audit reporting.

### 7. Detailed Requirements

7.1 Planning & Roadmap
- PRD, roadmap, and prioritized backlog published to `docs/planning/` with traceability IDs.
- Milestones aligned to Master Execution Schedule (Weeks 1–8) with capacity and estimates.

7.2 UX/UI
- Design tokens published; component specs for core UI (Nav, Table/List, Form, Status badge).
- Storybook/preview (or equivalent) with accessible components (WCAG 2.2 AA checks).

7.3 Architecture & API
- Versioned API contract for the Onboarding slice (OpenAPI or GraphQL) with mocks/stubs.
- ADRs for service boundaries, auth model, and data model sketch for Onboarding.

7.4 Implementation (FE/BE)
- FE: Onboarding flow UI using design tokens; consumes mocked API initially, then live.
- BE: Service skeleton for Onboarding with one create/read endpoint; feature-flagged.
- Tests: Unit and integration tests reach ≥ 80% coverage for slice modules.

7.5 QA & Security
- Contract tests green on integration branch; e2e smoke for Onboarding slice.
- SAST/DAST configured in CI; zero critical vulns in dependencies; SBOM attached to artifacts.

7.6 Release & Observability
- Merge train pipeline executes nightly; artifacts signed; canary to staging.
- Dashboards for latency, error rate, throughput; alerts with noise controls.

### 8. Acceptance Criteria (for UX & Implementation)
AC-UX-1: Design tokens exported; documented usage; contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
AC-UX-2: Storybook/preview shows 5 core components with keyboard navigation validated.
AC-FE-1: Onboarding UI submits a form and renders server response; error states handled.
AC-FE-2: Contract tests for FE⇄API pass in CI; no schema drift.
AC-BE-1: Onboarding service exposes POST /onboarding and GET /onboarding/{id}; OpenAPI published.
AC-BE-2: Unit/integration tests >= 80% coverage for Onboarding handlers and validation.
AC-QA-1: E2E smoke creates and retrieves an onboarding record in staging.
AC-SEC-1: CI fails on any critical vuln; SBOM is generated and attached to release artifacts.
AC-REL-1: Nightly merge train runs to completion with < 5% failure rate over 7 days.
AC-OBS-1: Dashboards display p95 latency, error rate, and RPS for Onboarding; alerts configured.

### 9. Constraints & NFRs (to Architecture)
- Performance: p95 latency < 300ms for onboarding read; < 800ms for create at MVP load.
- Availability: Staging ≥ 99% during work hours; production target ≥ 99.9% post-GA.
- Security: Least-privilege for CI/CD; signed artifacts; secret scanning enforced.
- Privacy: No production PII in test environments; data masking for demos.
- Compatibility: API contracts versioned; backward compatible minor changes; feature-flagged rollouts.

### 10. Dependency Map (FE/BE and External)
- FE depends on: design tokens (UX), API contract (Architecture), contract tests (QA).
- BE depends on: ADRs/API contract (Architecture), CI policies (Security), telemetry standards (Observability).
- Cross-cutting: Release pipelines (Release), SBOM/signing (Security), dashboards (Observability).
- External: GitHub/Git provider for merge train; CI runners; container registry; monitoring backend.

### 11. Risks & Mitigations
- Parallel churn on contracts → Mitigate via contract test gates and versioning.
- Overload of merge trains → Stagger large PRs; shard tests; cache artifacts.
- Accessibility gaps → Early UX checks; automated a11y tests in CI.
- Scope creep on slices → Hard MVP boundary; backlog parking lot for post-MVP.

### 12. Quality Gates & Approvals
- PRD sign-off by Product and Engineering leads before Week 3.
- Contract test suite green on integration branch before enabling nightly merge train.
- Security policy checks passing (SAST/DAST) required to merge to integration.

### 13. Traceability & References
- Source: `dev-workflow/0-master-planner-output.md` (Strategy B recommended).
- Prompts: `background-agents/prompts/01-discovery.md`, `background-agents/prompts/02-planning.md`.

### 14. Definition of Done (F2 Planning)
- PRD, roadmap, and prioritized backlog exist under `docs/planning/` and are approved by Product and Engineering leads.
- Traceability established: every backlog item (BL-IDs) maps to a milestone and related acceptance criteria (AC-IDs) where applicable.
- Clear FE/BE split and dependency map documented, with ROM estimates and risks/mitigations.
- Handoffs prepared for dependent frameworks:
  - To F3 UX: baseline design tokens and component scope references.
  - To F4 Architecture: API contract scope and ADR focus areas.
  - To F6 Implementation: MVP slice acceptance criteria and sequencing guidance.
  - To F7 QA: contract test gating approach and initial e2e smoke scope.
  - To F8 Security: CI policy baseline (SAST/DAST, SBOM) and gates.
  - To F9 Release: integration branch, merge-train expectations, and promotion flow.
  - To F10 Observability: initial SLO/SLI and dashboard metrics list.
