# Discovery Brief — F1 Discovery & Intake

- Traceability ID: DISC-BRIEF-001
- Version: 0.1 (Draft)
- Date: TBD
- Program: AI Governor Framework
- Related: dev-workflow/0-master-planner-output.md, README.md
- Recommended orchestration strategy reference: Strategy B — Swarm with Guardrails

## 1) Purpose and Scope

This brief synthesizes the problem definition, constraints, KPIs, and risks for the AI Governor Framework so downstream teams (Planning/PRD, UX, Architecture, Implementation, QA, Security, Release, Observability) can proceed in parallel with shared guardrails.

Scope covers the ten core frameworks with emphasis on early inputs required by Planning and UX. This brief is concise and actionable, prioritizing traceability and sign-offs.

## 2) Context Summary

- Vision from README: Govern AI development with in-repo rules and workflows so output is predictable, compliant, and aligned with architecture.
- Strategic backdrop from master planner: Ten-framework ecosystem executed in parallel; Strategy B recommends overlapped streams with contract tests, merge trains, and canary release gates.
- Outputs from this brief feed the PRD creation protocol and initial UX flows.

## 4) Stakeholder Interview Plan

- Objectives
  - Validate problem statements, constraints, and desired outcomes per stakeholder group
  - Capture risks, assumptions, and dependencies; identify contract test needs
  - Align on KPIs and sign-off criteria
- Participants (initial wave)
  - PM lead; FE/BE leads; Architecture; UX; QA; Security; Release; SRE; Privacy/Legal (if applicable)
- Method & Cadence
  - 45–60 min interviews; 2–3 days to complete first wave; async follow-ups via doc comments
- Core Questions (tailored by role)
  - What outcomes define “success” in 4–8 weeks? In 6 months?
  - What are your top 3 risks or constraints? Any non-negotiables?
  - Which contracts or standards must be established early? (APIs, tokens, telemetry)
  - What metrics are your leading indicators of risk or success?
  - What would make this workflow hard for your team to adopt?
- Artifacts
  - Interview notes stored adjacent to this brief as needed; updates propagate to PRD and RAD

## 5) Problem Statements (with desired outcomes)

- P1: Unpredictable AI output leads to rework and integration risk
  - From: Ad-hoc prompts produce inconsistent, architecture-agnostic code
  - To: Rules-driven, contract-first outputs with predictable quality
  - Outcome: Reduced rework; faster PR approvals; stable API adherence
- P2: Documentation and rules drift from the code
  - From: Knowledge spread across chats and ad-hoc docs
  - To: In-repo, versioned rules and READMEs synced to changes
  - Outcome: Higher onboarding speed; fewer regressions from context gaps
- P3: Security and compliance checks happen late
  - From: Vulnerabilities and policy violations discovered during release
  - To: Policy-as-code, SBOM, SAST/DAST integrated throughout CI
  - Outcome: Zero critical vulns; proactive privacy and audit readiness
- P4: Lack of cross-framework coordination under parallel work
  - From: Conflicts surface late due to siloed decisions
  - To: Strategy B with merge trains, contract tests, and canary gates
  - Outcome: Early conflict detection; fewer blocked PRs; safer rollouts
- P5: Limited observability inhibits fast recovery
  - From: Missing SLOs/SLIs, weak dashboards/alerts
  - To: Telemetry standards and actionable dashboards from first increment
  - Outcome: Lower MTTR and fewer noisy alerts

## 6) Success Metrics (KPIs)

Discovery-stage KPIs (short-term)
- KPI-DSC-001: Discovery Brief signed off by Product and Engineering by EOW2
- KPI-DSC-002: 100% stakeholder interviews completed; notes archived; decisions logged
- KPI-DSC-003: RAD register initialized with prioritization; top 5 risks mitigations assigned
- KPI-DSC-004: Traceability established (DISC-*, RISK-*, ASM-*, DEP-*, KPI-*) linked to docs/PRs

Program KPIs (ongoing, informed by Strategy B)
- KPI-PR-001: PR lead time reduces by 20–40% by end of Phase 2
- KPI-QA-001: Automated test coverage ≥ 80%; flake rate < 2%
- KPI-REL-001: DORA Change Failure Rate < 15%; MTTR < 24h
- KPI-SEC-001: Zero critical vulnerabilities on main; SBOM published per release
- KPI-OBS-001: SLOs defined, dashboards live, alert noise reduced by 30%
- KPI-ARCH-001: 100% API contracts versioned; contract tests green on integration branch

## 7) Constraints and Guardrails

- In-repo governance: All rules and workflows live and evolve in-repo; changes are versioned and reviewable
- Contract-first development: Architecture/API contracts and design tokens gate implementation
- Security-by-default: Policy-as-code and SBOM integrated into CI from the start
- Accessibility: UX targets WCAG 2.2 AA minimum
- Observability early: Instrumentation and dashboards begin with first increment

## 8) Integration Requirements

- Outputs from this brief feed:
  - Planning (PRD) with clear problem statements, KPIs, and constraints
  - UX (user flows, tokens) with validated user outcomes and accessibility targets
  - Architecture (ADRs, API contracts) with agreed performance budgets

## 9) Quality Gates and Sign-offs

- Required sign-offs: Product Lead, Engineering Lead
- Traceability: IDs attached to all artifacts; links to PRs and ADRs
- Gate policy: CI must validate contract tests and policy-as-code before merge to integration

## 10) Approvals

- Product Lead: Name, Date, Signature
