# FINAL CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS & CHANGESET REPORT

## Method
This file merges the outputs of two background agents (CHANGESET_AND_GLOBAL1 and CHANGESET_AND_GLOBAL2). It aligns overlapping findings, highlights unique contributions from each agent, and resolves conflicts by preserving the stricter or more governance-aligned interpretation.

## GLOBAL ANALYSIS (Merged)

### Common Findings Across Both Agents
- Security Critical (Critical=0) issues block readiness (â†’ **NO-GO**).
- Immutable handoff manifests with checksums and snapshot_rev required.
- Governance.tags[] and exception registries mandatory.
- QA schema coverage and Observability digests incomplete.

### Unique to Agent 1 (CHANGESET_AND_GLOBAL1)
- Granular schema alignment for QA compliance_map.md and manifests.
- Emphasis on Planning manifest path base alignment.

### Unique to Agent 2 (CHANGESET_AND_GLOBAL2)
- Governance overlay stronger: every manifest must emit governance.tags[].
- Snapshot unification: no mixed revisions across frameworks.
- Observability digests must include gate evidence, not just metrics.

### Consolidated Readiness Decision
- **NO-GO** until: (1) Security Criticals remediated, (2) manifests carry governance + snapshot integrity, (3) QA & Observability gates fully implemented.

## CHANGESET PLAN (Merged)

### Ordered Action List
1. **Security**
   - Add `security/findings.yaml` with Critical=0 issues.
   - Enforce waiver schema for exceptions.
   - Update manifests to emit governance.tags[] with expiry + owner.

2. **Planning**
   - Align `planning/manifests/` path bases.
   - Add governance.fields[] and snapshot_rev to every manifest.

3. **QA**
   - Create `qa/compliance_map.md` with schema coverage.
   - Enforce lint + coverage parity gates.

4. **Observability**
   - Generate `observability/digest_cycleN.md` with metrics + gate evidence.
   - Ensure MTTA/MTTR + incident summaries included.

### Cross-Framework Integration
- All manifests sealed with `snapshot_rev` and `rulebook_hash`.
- Each cycle emits QA + Security + Planning + Observability digests into `/memory-bank/digests/`.
- CI/CD workflow validates manifests, runs schema lint, enforces governance checks, and blocks release if Critical=0 unresolved.
