## Executive summary
- All four frameworks aligned to lifecycle PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE with explicit gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage).
- All manifests standardized to include snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[]; sealed with checksums; no mixed snapshots across frameworks.
- Security: new findings registry enforces Critical=0; waiver schema includes rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, compensating controls.
- Planning: FE/BE manifest path bases aligned; manifests augmented with snapshot_rev and governance.fields[]; sealed.
- QA: compliance_map added; parity/coverage and cross-stream consistency gates declared; sealed handoff manifest includes governance.tags[].
- Observability: per-cycle digest includes Gate Evidence sections (logs, metrics, validation results) and MTTA/MTTR, incident summaries; sealed observability manifest added.
- Memory spine: all framework digests are collected into /workspace/memory-bank/digests/<cycle>/ for executive rollups.
- CI/CD: governance workflow validates manifests, enforces Critical=0, and blocks release on any unresolved Critical.
- Snapshot integrity: a single snapshot_rev (git:abcdef1234 placeholder) is used across Security, Planning (FE/BE), QA, and Observability stubs.
- Readiness: NO-GO until Observability digests include attached gate evidence (not placeholders) and CI proves gates pass on sealed artifacts.

## Per-framework findings after applying the checklist

### Security
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/findings.yaml capturing Critical=0 and governance.tags[].
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.yaml with rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, compensating_controls.
  - Updated /workspace/frameworks/security/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml to include governance.tags[] with rationale + expiry; ensured snapshot_rev and rulebook_hash present; sealed.
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/rules/release_gates.yaml to block release if any Critical unresolved.
- What remains:
  - Populate real findings; if Critical detected, add time-bounded exceptions with compensating controls.
  - Execute CI gates and attach evidence into Observability digest.

### Planning (FE/BE)
- What changed:
  - Aligned manifest path bases to /workspace/frameworks/planning-fe/manifests/ and /workspace/frameworks/planning-be/manifests/.
  - Added snapshot_rev and governance.fields[] to all planning manifests; sealed with checksums and rulebook_hash.
- What remains:
  - Confirm governance.fields[] values (owners, risk, compliance) and run cross_stream_consistency against QA mappings.

### QA
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/artifacts/2025-09/compliance_map.md (schema coverage map).
  - Declared automated gates (schema_lint, parity/coverage, cross_stream_consistency) in /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/rules/gates.yaml.
  - Ensured sealed QA handoff manifest includes governance.tags[] and single snapshot_rev.
- What remains:
  - Record actual coverage metrics and evidence links; integrate with Observability gate evidence.

### Observability
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09-02-digest.md with KPI sections (MTTA/MTTR, incidents) and Gate Evidence sections (logs, metrics, validation).
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/observability/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml; sealed with snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[].
- What remains:
  - Attach concrete evidence artifacts (log excerpts, metric snapshots, CI validation outputs) and hash them into the manifest.

## Cross-framework integration map
- Planning-FE/BE → QA:
  - Producers: planning manifests and backlogs at /workspace/frameworks/planning-*/.
  - Consumers: QA test_matrix and compliance_map align story_ref/endpoint_ref for parity and cross-stream consistency.
- Security → Observability:
  - Producers: /workspace/frameworks/security/findings.yaml and exceptions.yaml.
  - Consumers: Observability digest Gate Evidence includes security gate results; CI release gate enforces Critical=0.
- QA → Observability:
  - Producers: sealed QA handoff manifest and artifacts (test_matrix, evidence index).
  - Consumers: Observability digest ingests gate outcomes and references evidence.
- All frameworks → Memory Bank:
  - Producers: per-cycle digests from QA, Security, Planning, Observability.
  - Consumer: /workspace/memory-bank/digests/<cycle>/ for executive roll-ups and audits.
- CI/CD:
  - Triggers on changes under /workspace/frameworks/**; runs schema_lint, consistency, parity; generates/validates sealed manifests; blocks on Critical>0.

## Final readiness decision: NO-GO
- Security Critical=0: Pass (design artifacts support Critical=0; actual finding status to be validated on CI).
- Snapshot integrity: Pass (single snapshot_rev across all stubs).
- QA gates: Declared but unproven (need CI results and evidence artifacts).
- Observability digests: Gate Evidence sections present but evidence not yet attached. Decision remains NO-GO until evidence is attached and CI gates pass on sealed manifests.

- Critical=0: security/findings.yaml summary.critical_open == 0 OR a valid exception exists with approved approver and non-expired expiry; release gate blocks otherwise.

## Owners & deadlines
- Security artifacts and gates: security-platform@company — by 2025-09-06/07.
- Planning-FE/BE manifests alignment: fe-planning@company, be-planning@company — by 2025-09-07.

# GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_vNext.md

## Executive summary (≤10 bullets)

- Governance and sealing fields require normalization across frameworks (add governance.tags[], snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash).
- Security Critical=0 gate lacks a canonical findings/waivers registry; create and wire to CI.
- Planning manifests need governance fields and a sealed handoff manifest to ensure snapshot integrity.
- QA artifacts largely present; add governance block to handoff manifest and ensure compliance_map header.
- Observability digest must include gate evidence sections, not just KPIs; add sealed manifest.
- Cross-stream gates (schema_lint, consistency, parity/coverage) must be enforced in CI with block_on_fail.
- Snapshot integrity requires single snapshot_rev for the cycle (no mixed revisions across frameworks).
- Memory-bank collector should link all per-cycle digests to enable auditability.
- Minimal exceptions allowed only with explicit expiry, approver, and compensating controls.
- Readiness contingent on passing all gates and Security Critical=0 (or valid, unexpired exceptions).

## Per-framework findings after applying checklist

### Security
- What changed: Added design for `frameworks/security/findings.yaml` and `frameworks/security/waivers.yaml` with required fields, governance.tags[], snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- Gaps remaining: Findings content TBD; ensure any accepted_risk items reference valid, unexpired waivers with compensating controls.
- Gates: `security_critical_zero` integrated via CI using findings + waivers.

### Planning
- What changed: Governance fields/tags to be added to `frameworks/planning-fe/tasks/2025-09-02-fe_task_breakdown.yaml` and `frameworks/planning-be/backlog/2025-09-02-be_backlog.yaml` plus a new sealed planning handoff manifest.
- Gaps remaining: Compute checksums when sealing; confirm no mixed `snapshot_rev` across FE/BE/QA.
- Gates: `schema_lint`, `snapshot_integrity` pass when manifests contain required fields and aligned snapshot.

### QA
- What changed: Add governance.tags[] to QA handoff manifest; ensure compliance_map has metadata header (snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[]).
- Gaps remaining: None functionally, assuming existing test_matrix and evidence index validate against schemas.
- Gates: `schema_lint`, `cross_stream_consistency`, `parity/coverage` enforced; parity threshold >= 0.9.

### Observability
- What changed: Introduce per-cycle digest with KPI (MTTA, MTTR), incident summaries, and Gate Evidence; add sealed observability handoff manifest.
- Gaps remaining: Populate actual KPI values and attach evidence (links to logs/metrics).
- Gates: Evidence presence check (non-empty sections) and manifest schema lint.

## Cross-framework integration map

- Producers → Artifacts → Consumers
  - Security → `frameworks/security/findings.yaml`, `frameworks/security/waivers.yaml` → CI gate `security_critical_zero`, Observability digest (gate evidence)
  - Planning → FE/BE manifests, sealed `frameworks/planning/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml` → QA consistency checks, CI snapshot_integrity gate, Observability digest
  - QA → `frameworks/qa-test/artifacts/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml`, `test_matrix.yaml`, `compliance_map.md` → CI schema_lint, consistency, parity gates; Observability digest
  - Observability → `frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md`, sealed manifest → Memory bank collector, Exec reporting
  - Integration → `dev-workflow/ci/gates_config.yaml` → All CI workflows and release pipeline
  - Aggregation → `memory-bank/digests/2025-09/index.md` → Executives, Audit, Runbooks

## Final readiness decision

Decision: NO-GO

Rationale tied to gates:
- `security_critical_zero`: Pending; findings registry not yet populated, and exceptions not validated → block.
- `schema_lint`: Expected to pass after planned updates, but enforcement not yet configured in CI → block until `dev-workflow/ci/gates_config.yaml` lands.
- `cross_stream_consistency`: Expected to pass (QA ↔ Planning mappings align), but must be revalidated post-governance updates.
- `parity/coverage`: Threshold (≥0.9) expected to pass based on current test_matrix; must be verified in CI and captured in Observability Gate Evidence.
- `snapshot_integrity`: Will pass once sealed Planning manifest confirms single `snapshot_rev` across frameworks; currently unsealed → block.
- Observability Gate Evidence: Digest exists for QA, but standardized evidence sections across all frameworks are not yet published → block.

### 11) CI Gates Configuration (new)
- name: CI gates config
- path: dev-workflow/ci/gates_config.yaml
- required fields: schema_version, gates {schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity_coverage, security_critical_zero}, enforcement_mode: block_on_fail

```yaml
schema_version: 1
gates:
  schema_lint: true
  cross_stream_consistency: true
  parity_coverage:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.9
  security_critical_zero:
    enabled: true
    source: frameworks/security/findings.yaml
    exceptions: frameworks/security/waivers.yaml
enforcement_mode: block_on_fail
```

## Gate Checks to Run After Each Change

- After 1–2 (Security): security_critical_zero → PASS when no Critical open OR all mapped to valid exceptions (unexpired, with compensating controls)
- After 3–7 (QA/Planning): schema_lint → PASS; snapshot_integrity → PASS (all snapshot_rev == git:abcdef1234)
- After 3 & 6 (QA/Planning cross): cross_stream_consistency → PASS (test_matrix story_ref and endpoint_ref resolve in planning)
- After 8–9 (Observability): schema_lint (manifests) + evidence_present check → PASS (Gate Evidence section populated)
- After 10–11 (Integration/CI): dry-run pipeline → PASS (all configured gates evaluate to pass or block as intended)

## Owners & Deadlines (placeholders)

- Security (items 1–2): owner security-lead@example.com — deadline 2025-09-10
- QA (items 3–4): owner qa-platform@example.com — deadline 2025-09-08
- Planning (items 5–7): owner planning-pmo@example.com — deadline 2025-09-09
- Observability (items 8–9): owner obs-team@example.com — deadline 2025-09-08
- Integration/CI (items 10–11): owner release-eng@example.com — deadline 2025-09-11

## Lifecycle and Governance Enforcement

- Lifecycle states to record per artifact: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE
- Every manifest/digest must carry: snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[]
- Sealed manifests (QA/Planning/Observability/Security) must include checksums for artifacts and be immutable once sealed
