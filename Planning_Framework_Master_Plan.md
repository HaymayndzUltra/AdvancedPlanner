## Planning Framework (Frontend) — Design Proposal

### 1) Executive Summary
This document proposes a complete, artifact-first planning framework for the frontend (FE) organization. It provides a lifecycle of events from PLANNED to IMPROVE, governed by explicit quality gates and sealed via an immutable handoff manifest. The framework uses interoperable artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON), overlays governance through tags with a Critical=0 rule, and anchors a metrics spine that emits a per-cycle digest for visibility and continuous improvement.

### 2) Deliverables
Per cycle, the framework produces the following artifacts, optimized for artifact-first interop and automation:
- fe_task_breakdown.yaml: Work items (epics/stories/tasks), owners, estimates, dependencies, tags.
- story_map.md: User journey, capabilities, slices, and phased delivery alignment.
- handoff_manifest.yaml: Immutable, sealed manifest with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- digest.md: Metrics spine digest summarizing KPIs, gates, and improvement actions.

Suggested locations and naming (cycle_id = YYYY-MM-DD or sprint tag):
- `frameworks/planning-fe/tasks/{cycle_id}-fe_task_breakdown.yaml`
- `frameworks/planning-fe/storymaps/{cycle_id}-story_map.md`
- `frameworks/planning-fe/manifests/{cycle_id}-handoff_manifest.yaml`
- `frameworks/planning-fe/digests/{cycle_id}-digest.md`

Artifact-first interop:
- YAML/JSON: machine-readable, schema-linted; MD: human-first summaries with structured front matter.
- All artifacts reference each other by stable identifiers and are sealed by the handoff manifest.

### 3) Events & Gates
Lifecycle events:
1. PLANNED
2. READY_FOR_HANDOFF
3. PACKAGED
4. EXECUTED
5. VALIDATED
6. IMPROVE

Quality gates applied (minimum) at transitions:
- schema_lint: All YAML/JSON/MD front matter validate against versioned schemas.
- cross_stream_consistency: Dependencies across FE/BE/Design match and are satisfied or stubbed.
- parity/coverage: Story-map parity with backlog and minimum test coverage delta thresholds are met.

Event → Gate mapping (summary):
- PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage (planning level checks).
- READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED: schema_lint re-run, manifest pre-check, Critical=0 governance.
- PACKAGED → EXECUTED: release-readiness checks; unchanged manifest checksum confirmation.
- EXECUTED → VALIDATED: outcome validation, KPI measurement, parity/coverage post-exec.
- VALIDATED → IMPROVE: retrospective signatures and improvement backlog entries captured.

### 4) Workflow
Step-by-step per cycle:
1. Author fe_task_breakdown.yaml and story_map.md from discovery inputs.
2. Run schema_lint to ensure artifacts comply with schemas; fix issues until clean.
3. Run cross_stream_consistency to verify FE←→BE dependencies and design/assets alignment.
4. Compute parity/coverage: confirm each story in story_map.md has a corresponding backlog item and required test coverage thresholds are planned (and later measured post-exec).
5. Generate handoff_manifest.yaml with checksums of all referenced artifacts, `snapshot_rev` (e.g., git commit SHA), and `rulebook_hash` (hash of governance rulebook).
6. Seal handoff_manifest.yaml (immutable) and move state to READY_FOR_HANDOFF once gates pass and Critical=0 holds.
7. Package for execution (PACKAGED), ensuring no changes to sealed artifacts; if changes are needed, open a new cycle or increment cycle with a new manifest.
8. Execute delivery (EXECUTED) and collect outcomes (test results, coverage, defects, lead time).
9. Validate outcomes (VALIDATED) against acceptance criteria and governance rules.
10. Publish digest.md with KPIs, gate outcomes, and improvement actions; transition to IMPROVE and seed next cycle.

### 5) Handoff & Sealing
Immutable handoff manifest requirements:
- Checksums: SHA-256 for each artifact path, recorded in a map keyed by normalized path.
- snapshot_rev: Exact VCS revision of the repository state when the manifest was created.
- rulebook_hash: SHA-256 of the governance rulebook (e.g., YAML configuration of policies).
- Signatures: Optional cryptographic signature(s) from accountable roles; required for regulated streams.
- Immutability: Once sealed, the manifest and referenced artifact files cannot be modified. Any change requires a new cycle_id and new manifest.

Manifest schema (illustrative):
```yaml
version: 1
cycle_id: YYYY-MM-DD
snapshot_rev: "<git_sha>"
rulebook_hash: "<sha256>"
artifacts:
  - path: frameworks/planning-fe/tasks/{cycle_id}-fe_task_breakdown.yaml
    sha256: "<sha256>"
  - path: frameworks/planning-fe/storymaps/{cycle_id}-story_map.md
    sha256: "<sha256>"
  - path: frameworks/planning-fe/digests/{cycle_id}-digest.md
    sha256: "<sha256>"
governance:
  tags: ["Release", "Scope:Core", "Risk:Low"]
  critical_issues: 0
sealed_at: "<iso8601>"
sealed_by: ["PM", "TechLead", "QA"]
signature: "<optional-detached-signature>"
```

### 6) Governance Integration
Governance overlay:
- tags[]: Applied at epic/story/task level (e.g., Scope, Risk, Component, Priority, Compliance).
- Critical=0 rule: At handoff and packaging, there must be zero open Critical severity issues (planning defects, security blockers, governance violations). Gate must hard-fail if `critical_issues > 0`.
- Rulebook: Versioned YAML defining rules (thresholds, required tags, approvers). The `rulebook_hash` is included in the manifest to ensure deterministic governance context.
- Enforcement: CI jobs evaluate rules; failures block state transitions. Overrides require a new cycle with documented rationale.

### 7) Metrics & Digest
Metrics spine (KPIs captured per cycle):
- Plan accuracy (% scope completed vs committed)
- Lead time (story start→prod), Cycle time (dev start→merge)
- Test coverage delta (unit/e2e), Accessibility checks pass rate
- Defect counts (by severity), Defect escape rate
- Cross-stream dependency fulfillment rate
- DORA metrics (deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR)

Digest file (digest.md) content (summary of the cycle):
- Cycle metadata (cycle_id, dates, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash)
- KPI table with deltas vs previous cycle
- Gate outcomes (pass/fail) with evidence links
- Manifest excerpt and verification checksum
- Improvement actions (owners, due dates), carried to next fe_task_breakdown.yaml

### 8) Acceptance Criteria
- All four deliverables exist, validate against schemas, and interlink correctly.
- All quality gates pass for each lifecycle transition; evidence is stored.
- Handoff manifest is sealed, immutable, and includes valid checksums, snapshot_rev, and rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay present with tags[] and Critical=0 satisfied at sealing.
- Digest published with KPIs and improvement actions; metrics are reproducible.

### 9) Risks & Mitigations
- Drift between story_map.md and fe_task_breakdown.yaml → Mitigation: automated parity check, pre-merge hook.
- Governance friction (false positives) → Mitigation: rulebook versioning, fast-feedback linting locally.
- Immutable sealing too early → Mitigation: require READY_FOR_HANDOFF dry run before sealing.
- Cross-stream dependency slippage → Mitigation: explicit dependency contracts and escalation policy.
- Metrics integrity issues → Mitigation: data provenance, snapshot_rev pinning, and checksum verification in CI.

### 10) Timeline & Next Steps
Week 1: Define schemas, wire up schema_lint and basic governance rulebook.
Week 2: Implement cross_stream_consistency checks and parity/coverage calculators.
Week 3: Produce first full cycle artifacts and seal manifest; pilot in one squad.
Week 4: Roll out metrics spine and digest automation; review and refine rulebook.
Next: Expand to multi-stream coordination (FE/BE/Design), integrate with release trains, and automate Critical=0 dashboards.

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Workflow

### 4.1 Planning Creation Workflow

```python
# Pseudo-code for planning workflow
class PlanningWorkflow:
    def create_plan(self, request):
        # 1. Parse and validate input
        plan = parse_planning_request(request)
        validate_schema(plan, "planning_schema_v1.json")
        
        # 2. Enrich with metadata
        plan.metadata = {
            "created_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "tags": extract_tags(plan),
            "priority": calculate_priority(plan)
        }
        
        # 3. Persist and emit event
        plan_id = persist_plan(plan)
        emit_event("PLAN_CREATED", plan_id, "PLANNED")
        
        return plan_id
    
    def transition_state(self, plan_id, target_state):
        # 1. Load current state
        plan = load_plan(plan_id)
        current_state = plan.state
        
        # 2. Validate transition
        if not is_valid_transition(current_state, target_state):
            raise InvalidTransition(f"{current_state} -> {target_state}")
        
        # 3. Execute quality gates
        gate_results = execute_gates(plan, target_state)
        if not all(gate_results.values()):
            return handle_gate_failure(plan, gate_results)
        
        # 4. Update state and emit event
        plan.state = target_state
        persist_plan(plan)
        emit_event("STATE_TRANSITION", plan_id, target_state)
```

### 4.2 Automated Gate Execution

```yaml
# Gate configuration
gates:
  schema_lint:
    triggers:
      - from: PLANNED
        to: READY_FOR_HANDOFF
    validators:
      - type: json_schema
        schema: planning_schema_v1.json
      - type: yaml_lint
        config: strict_mode.yaml
      - type: custom
        script: validate_references.py
    
  cross_stream_consistency:
    triggers:
      - from: READY_FOR_HANDOFF
        to: PACKAGED
    validators:
      - type: dependency_graph
        max_depth: 5
      - type: timeline_checker
        horizon_days: 90
      - type: resource_validator
        capacity_model: team_capacity.yaml
```

## 5. Handoff & Sealing

### 5.1 Handoff Manifest Generation

The handoff process creates an immutable record of all planning artifacts:

```python
class HandoffGenerator:
    def create_manifest(self, plan_id):
        # 1. Collect all artifacts
        artifacts = {
            "be_backlog": load_artifact("be_backlog.yaml"),
            "story_map": load_artifact("story_map.md"),
            "schemas": load_schemas(plan_id),
            "configurations": load_configs(plan_id)
        }
        
        # 2. Generate checksums
        checksums = {}
        for name, content in artifacts.items():
            checksums[name] = hashlib.sha256(content.encode()).hexdigest()
        
        # 3. Create manifest
        manifest = {
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "id": generate_manifest_id(),
            "created_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "plan_id": plan_id,
            "snapshot_rev": get_git_revision(),
            "checksums": checksums,
            "rulebook_hash": compute_rulebook_hash()
        }
        
        # 4. Seal with signature
        manifest["seal"] = seal_manifest(manifest)
        
        return manifest
```

### 5.2 Sealing Process

```yaml
# Sealing configuration
sealing:
  algorithm: RSA-SHA256
  key_management:
    type: HSM  # Hardware Security Module
    key_id: planning_seal_key_v1
  
  verification:
    required_signatures: 2
    signers:
      - role: planning_lead

## 6. Governance Integration

### 6.1 Tag-Based Policies

```yaml
# Governance tag configuration
governance:
  tags:
    - name: compliance
      values: [sox, gdpr, hipaa, none]
      default: none
      
    - name: criticality
      values: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # 0 = Critical
      default: 2
      
    - name: data_classification
      values: [public, internal, confidential, restricted]
      default: internal
  
  rules:
    critical_zero:
      condition: "tags.criticality == 0"
      requirements:
        - approval_count: 3
        - review_board: true
        - emergency_contact: required
        - rollback_plan: mandatory
    
    compliance_sox:
      condition: "tags.compliance == 'sox'"
      requirements:
        - audit_trail: enhanced
        - change_freeze: check_calendar
        - documentation: regulatory_standard
```

### 6.2 Policy Enforcement

```python
class GovernanceEngine:
    def enforce_policies(self, plan):
        # 1. Extract tags
        tags = plan.metadata.get("tags", {})
        
        # 2. Apply Critical=0 rule
        if tags.get("criticality") == 0:
            enforce_critical_requirements(plan)
        
        # 3. Check compliance tags
        compliance_tag = tags.get("compliance", "none")
        if compliance_tag != "none":
            apply_compliance_rules(plan, compliance_tag)
        
        # 4. Validate against policies
        violations = []
        for rule in load_governance_rules():
            if evaluate_condition(rule.condition, tags):
                violations.extend(check_requirements(plan, rule.requirements))
        
        if violations:
            raise GovernanceViolation(violations)
```

            "quality_metrics": collect_quality_metrics(cycle_id),
            "governance_compliance": check_governance_compliance(cycle_id)
        }
        
        # 2. Calculate KPIs
        kpis = {}
        for kpi_name, kpi_config in load_kpi_definitions().items():
            kpis[kpi_name] = calculate_kpi(metrics, kpi_config)
        
        # 3. Generate insights
        insights = analyze_trends(metrics, previous_cycles=3)
        
        # 4. Create digest
        digest = render_digest_template(
            cycle_id=cycle_id,
            metrics=metrics,
            kpis=kpis,
            insights=insights
        )
        
        return digest
```

Proposal: planning-fe design
### 1) Executive Summary

This document defines a complete Planning Framework module for the frontend (planning-fe) with artifact-first interoperability and a deterministic event lifecycle. The framework privileges durable, portable artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON) to encode scope, intent, and evidence; enforces quality gates at lifecycle transitions; and produces an immutable, checksummed handoff manifest compliant with governance. Each planning cycle emits a digest capturing KPIs, gate outcomes, and improvement actions.

Lifecycle states: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE. At each relevant transition, quality gates run: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, and parity/coverage. Handoffs are sealed via a manifest with checksums, a snapshot_rev, and a rulebook_hash. A governance overlay uses tags[] and enforces a Critical==0 rule. A metrics spine defines KPIs and produces a digest per cycle for traceability and review.


### 2) Deliverables (fe_task_breakdown.yaml, story_map.md, handoff_manifest.yaml, digest.md)

- fe_task_breakdown.yaml: Canonical FE task inventory for the cycle.
- story_map.md: User outcomes, journeys, and release slices for FE scope.
- handoff_manifest.yaml: Immutable manifest sealing a releasable unit.
- digest.md: Per-cycle metrics summary and decisions log.

Locations and naming:
- Proposal: `/reports/agent_reviews/planning-fe/<date>-proposal.md` (this doc)
- Digest: `/frameworks/planning-fe/digests/<date>-digest.md`
- Planning artifacts (suggested): `/frameworks/planning-fe/artifacts/<snapshot_rev>/...`

Artifact-first interop (YAML/MD/JSON):
- YAML for structured data (tasks, manifest) with explicit schemas.
- Markdown for narrative artifacts (story map, digest) with structured sections.
- JSON optionally mirrored for API/automation consumption.

Key field expectations:
- fe_task_breakdown.yaml entries: id, title, description, owner, tags[], priority, effort, status, dependencies[], acceptance_criteria[], risk, planned_in, linked_story_map_nodes[].
- handoff_manifest.yaml: manifest_id, sealed=true, created_at, created_by, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, artifact_checksums{path→sha256}, gate_results{schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity_coverage}, governance{tags[], critical_violations, decision_log_ref}, prior_manifest_id(optional), notes.


### 3) Events & Gates

Lifecycle events:
- PLANNED: Scope defined; tasks and story map drafted.
- READY_FOR_HANDOFF: Scope frozen; gates pass; manifest prepared for sealing.
- PACKAGED: Artifacts packaged and checksummed; manifest sealed and published.
- EXECUTED: Work executed against the sealed plan; deviations recorded.
- VALIDATED: Outcomes measured; parity/coverage verified; acceptance criteria met.
- IMPROVE: Retrospective and improvements queued into the next PLANNED.

Quality gates (run at transitions as noted):
- schema_lint (PLANNED→READY_FOR_HANDOFF): All YAML/JSON conform to schemas; required fields set; IDs unique and resolvable.
- cross_stream_consistency (PLANNED→READY_FOR_HANDOFF): FE plan aligns with dependencies (e.g., BE, Design); no dangling contracts.
- parity/coverage (VALIDATED→IMPROVE): Planned vs executed parity; coverage thresholds met (e.g., % of planned tasks delivered, scope variance, test parity where applicable).

Exit criteria per transition:
- To enter READY_FOR_HANDOFF: schema_lint=pass, cross_stream_consistency=pass, governance Critical==0.
- To enter PACKAGED: immutable handoff_manifest.yaml created with checksums; signatures (if used) collected.
- To enter EXECUTED: packaging published; execution change log enabled; deviations tracked.
- To enter VALIDATED: execution completed; evidence attached; parity/coverage computed.
- To enter IMPROVE: validation complete; digest finalized; improvement items captured.


### 4) Workflow

1) Author artifacts (PLANNED)
- Draft story_map.md (outcomes, slices) and fe_task_breakdown.yaml (tasks).
- Assign owners, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Tag risks and priorities.

2) Validate and freeze scope
- Run schema_lint on all YAML/JSON.
- Run cross_stream_consistency checks against upstream/downstream plans.
- Apply governance overlay; enforce Critical==0.

3) Prepare for handoff (READY_FOR_HANDOFF)
- Compute checksums (sha256) for every artifact referenced.
- Capture snapshot_rev (git SHA or semantic snapshot tag) and rulebook_hash (hash of the gate and governance ruleset).

4) Package and seal (PACKAGED)
- Assemble handoff_manifest.yaml with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, gate_results, governance fields, and sealed=true.
- Optionally sign manifest; publish to the repo location and/or artifact registry.

5) Execute (EXECUTED)
- Track deviations, scope changes, and exception approvals. Link back to tasks by id.

6) Validate (VALIDATED)
- Compute parity/coverage; verify acceptance criteria; mark validation status per task.

7) Improve (IMPROVE)
- Produce cycle digest.md (KPIs, deltas, decisions, follow-ups). File improvement backlog for next PLANNED.


### 5) Handoff & Sealing

- Immutability: handoff_manifest.yaml is immutable once sealed. Any changes require a new manifest_id and snapshot_rev with explicit linkage to the prior_manifest_id.
- Checksums: Use SHA-256 per artifact path; store as artifact_checksums{path→sha256}.
- Snapshot: snapshot_rev anchors the artifact set to a repository state (e.g., git commit SHA or tag).
- Rulebook: rulebook_hash is a stable hash of the ruleset for gates and governance; changes require recalculation.
- Publication: Store the sealed manifest alongside artifacts (e.g., `/frameworks/planning-fe/artifacts/<snapshot_rev>/handoff_manifest.yaml`) and reference it from the digest.


### 6) Governance Integration

- tags[] overlay: Every task and artifact supports free-form tags (e.g., Critical, Regulatory, Security, UX, Performance).
- Critical==0 rule: Requires zero critical violations to progress at any gate. Violations include missing acceptance criteria for Critical items, failing cross-stream contracts, or missing owners.
- Decision log: Governance outcomes and waivers recorded and referenced in handoff_manifest.yaml.governance.decision_log_ref and summarized in the digest.


### 7) Metrics & Digest

KPI spine (tracked per cycle and summarized in digest.md):
- Plan accuracy: delivered_vs_planned_ratio.
- On-time handoffs: percent of READY_FOR_HANDOFF by planned date.
- Cross-stream pass rate: cross_stream_consistency pass % at first run.
- Parity/coverage: % coverage vs target; variance of scope (+/-).
- Governance compliance: Critical violations count (must be 0), waivers used.
- Gate reliability: re-run rate to green; mean time to green.

Digest content:
- Metadata: cycle id/date, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, owners.
- Gate outcomes: pass/fail, evidence links.
- KPI table with targets vs actuals and deltas.
- Scope changes and deviations summary with references to tasks.
- Decisions, risks, and improvement actions queued.


### 8) Acceptance Criteria

- All four artifacts exist for the cycle: fe_task_breakdown.yaml, story_map.md, handoff_manifest.yaml, digest.md.
- Lifecycle transitions are recorded and only occur when gates pass.
- handoff_manifest.yaml is sealed, immutable, and includes checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, gate results, and governance metadata.
- Governance Critical==0 enforced at all required gates; any waivers explicitly documented.
- Digest published with KPI spine and links to manifest and artifacts.
- Traceability: every task links to story map nodes and appears in at least one KPI.


### 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Schema drift — Mitigation: lock schemas via rulebook_hash, add schema versioning and CI enforcement.
- Risk: Cross-stream misalignment — Mitigation: automated contract checks; explicit dependency records and owners.
- Risk: Overhead/perceived bureaucracy — Mitigation: provide templates, pre-commit hooks, and fast linting to reduce friction.
- Risk: Incomplete evidence at validation — Mitigation: require acceptance_criteria and evidence refs before VALIDATED.
- Risk: Manifest tampering — Mitigation: checksums and optional signing; store manifests in write-once locations.


### 10) Timeline & Next Steps

- Day 0–1: Finalize schemas and rulebook; agree on KPI spine.
- Day 2–3: Author templates for fe_task_breakdown.yaml, story_map.md, handoff_manifest.yaml, and digest.md.
- Day 4: Wire CI checks (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency) and governance overlay.
- Day 5: Dry-run a cycle; seal a sample manifest; publish the first digest.
- Week 2: Pilot on one product slice; refine based on IMPROVE feedback; roll out broadly.
