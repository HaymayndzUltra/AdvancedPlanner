## Executive summary
- All frameworks conceptually align to lifecycle PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE, but several artifacts lack lifecycle_state fields.
- Sealed handoff manifests exist as stubs; checksums are placeholders and must be computed and frozen.
- Path inconsistencies exist for Observability digests and Security exceptions/waivers; standardize paths across docs and CI.
- Security gate uses summary.critical_open (present in one stub), but another stub omits summary; unify schema and CI evaluation.
- QA handoff manifest update shows only governance.tags[], not full sealing fields; confirm and backfill snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, sealed, artifacts with checksums.
- Planning FE/BE manifests lack lifecycle_state; add and ensure a single snapshot_rev across FE/BE/QA/Security/Observability.
- Metrics spine incomplete: only Observability digest is defined; add per-cycle digests for Security, Planning, and QA.
- Governance: governance.tags[] is usually present, but enforce everywhere including digests and manifests; ensure Security exceptions carry approver, expiry, and rationale.
- CI/CD workflow and gates config are designed but not proven; wire them to enforce schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage, and Critical=0.
- Readiness: NO-GO until evidence-backed digests are attached, checksums computed, paths normalized, and CI proves all gates on sealed, immutable artifacts.

## Global rules conformance (by evidence)
- Event lifecycle: partial. Missing lifecycle_state in several manifests/digests. See: /workspace/FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_V3.md L137-L160, L183-L200, L206-L221, L312-L334, L601-L628. Lifecycle standard reference: /workspace/End_to_End_Master_Plan_WITH_Instructions.md L3325-L3329.
- Quality gates: declared; enforcement pending CI wiring. See: /workspace/FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_V3.md L248-L260 (QA gates), L164-L179 (Security gate rule), L349-L368 and L669-L681 (CI config stubs).
- Immutable handoff: manifests marked sealed but have empty checksums; compute and freeze. See: /workspace/FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_V3.md L147-L153, L195-L200, L218-L221, L322-L331, L588-L597, L644-L647.
- Governance: tags present in most stubs; ensure in all, including digests and exceptions. See: /workspace/FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_V3.md L142-L147, L188-L195, L211-L218, L267-L269, L282-L284, L319-L321, L585-L587, L641-L647, L669-L681.
- Metrics spine: Observability digest defined; others missing. See: /workspace/FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_V3.md L274-L309, L600-L628; memory bank index references additional digests that don’t exist yet, L339-L345, L655-L661.

## Per-framework findings and fixes

### Security
Gaps and inconsistencies
- Exceptions/waivers path conflict: /workspace/frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.yaml (L108-L131) vs frameworks/security/waivers.yaml (L495-L517) and CI expecting frameworks/security/waivers.yaml (L676-L679).
- findings.yaml schema divergence: release gate relies on summary.critical_open (L167-L176) but later stub (L473-L493) has findings[] without summary; current earlier stub (L89-L104) includes summary (L97-L101).
- Security handoff manifest lacks lifecycle_state and has empty checksums (L137-L160, L147-L153).
- No security per-cycle digest; memory index references a non-existent security digest (L340-L345 vs L655-L661).

Actionable fixes
- Standardize exceptions registry to /workspace/frameworks/security/waivers.yaml; update any references currently pointing to /workspace/frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.yaml (L108-L131).
- Unify findings.yaml schema to include both findings[] and summary.critical_open; adjust gate evaluation to compute summary if missing.
- Add lifecycle_state: PACKAGED to security handoff manifest and compute sha256 for findings.yaml and waivers.yaml before sealing.
- Add /workspace/frameworks/security/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md with governance front matter, KPI summary (e.g., Critical=0 proof), and Gate Evidence; include governance.tags[].
- Update memory bank index to point to the added security digest (see Cross-framework fixes).

### Planning (FE/BE)
Gaps and inconsistencies
- FE/BE handoff manifests omit lifecycle_state; see FE L183-L200, BE L206-L221.
- Checksums are placeholders; must be computed and sealed (L195-L200, L218-L221).
- Planning sealed aggregator manifest path exists at frameworks/planning/manifests/... (L576), which is fine, but must also carry lifecycle_state and actual checksums (L579-L597).

Actionable fixes
- Add lifecycle_state: PACKAGED to FE/BE manifests and aggregator manifest.
- Compute sha256 for FE tasks and BE backlog; insert into FE/BE manifests and the planning aggregator manifest.
- Enforce snapshot_integrity across FE/BE/QA/Security/Observability at CI (L669-L681).

### QA
Gaps and inconsistencies
- Handoff manifest update only shows governance.tags[] (L264-L271); confirm snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, sealed, artifacts with checksums are present; otherwise add.
- No QA per-cycle digest referenced; memory bank index implies a QA digest (L340-L345, L655-L661) but none is defined.

Actionable fixes
- Ensure /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml includes snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, sealed, artifacts with sha256, lifecycle_state: PACKAGED.
- Add /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md with KPIs (coverage, parity), Gate Evidence, governance.tags[].
- Keep QA gates config at /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/rules/gates.yaml (L248-L260); wire to CI.

### Observability
Gaps and inconsistencies
- Digest path inconsistent: /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09-02-digest.md (L274-L309, L323-L325) vs /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md (L600-L628); standardize.
- Digest sections are placeholders; Gate Evidence lacks concrete attachments (L292-L301).
- Observability handoff manifest lacks lifecycle_state (L312-L334).

Actionable fixes
- Standardize digest path to /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md; update manifest references accordingly.
- Attach evidence artifacts (log excerpts, metric snapshots, CI outputs) and include their sha256 checksums in the observability handoff manifest.
- Add lifecycle_state: PACKAGED to observability handoff manifest.

## Cross-framework gaps and integration fixes

Gaps
- Mixed absolute vs relative paths across docs (e.g., L181-L224 vs L576-L681).
- Memory bank index paths inconsistent (L336-L347 vs L651-L660).
- CI wiring is illustrative only; enforcement not proven (L349-L368, L669-L681).

Fixes
- Normalize all references to absolute paths under /workspace/...; update all manifests and CI configs accordingly.
- Use a single memory bank index at /workspace/memory-bank/digests/2025-09/index.md referencing:
  - /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md
  - /workspace/frameworks/security/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md
  - /workspace/frameworks/planning/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md
  - /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09/digest_2025-09-02.md
- Finalize /.github/workflows/frameworks-governance.yml and /workspace/dev-workflow/ci/gates_config.yaml; ensure CI fails on any gate violation.

Smallest exceptions (time-bounded, with compensating controls)
- If Gate Evidence cannot be attached immediately: temporary exception OBS-EVIDENCE-EXP-2025-09 with 7-day expiry and compensating control of tightened monitoring and manual on-call validation.
- If an open critical Security finding exists: temporary waiver EX-CRIT-BLOCK-2025-09 with CISO approval, 14-day expiry, and added WAF rule plus high-sensitivity alerting.

## Cross-framework integration plan
- Producers → Artifacts → Consumers
  - Planning (FE/BE) → /workspace/frameworks/planning-*/manifests/... (sealed) → QA for parity and cross_stream_consistency; CI snapshot_integrity.
  - QA → /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/manifests/... (sealed), /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/digests/... → Observability Gate Evidence; CI parity/coverage and schema_lint.
  - Security → /workspace/frameworks/security/findings.yaml, /workspace/frameworks/security/waivers.yaml, /workspace/frameworks/security/digests/... → CI Critical=0 gate; Observability Gate Evidence.
  - Observability → /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/... (evidence-attached), /workspace/frameworks/observability/manifests/... (sealed) → Memory bank index; Executive rollups.
  - Aggregation → /workspace/memory-bank/digests/2025-09/index.md → Executives, Audit, Runbooks.

## Final readiness decision
- Decision: NO-GO
- Rationale: Evidence attachments are missing, checksums are not computed, lifecycle_state missing in several artifacts, path inconsistencies unresolved, and CI enforcement is not yet proven on sealed artifacts with a single snapshot_rev and rulebook_hash.
