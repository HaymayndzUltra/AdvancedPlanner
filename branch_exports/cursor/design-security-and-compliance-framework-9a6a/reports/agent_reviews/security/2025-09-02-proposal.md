### 1) Executive Summary

This proposal defines a complete, artifact‑first Security & Compliance framework module designed for interoperability across pipelines through YAML/MD/JSON files. It introduces a deterministic event lifecycle (PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE), mandatory quality gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage), and an immutable handoff manifest that seals deliverables with checksums, a snapshot_rev, and a rulebook_hash. A governance overlay standardizes tags[] (PII, auth, license, etc.), enforces a Critical=0 rule at handoff, and maintains a time‑boxed exception registry. A metrics spine defines KPIs and produces a per‑cycle digest to drive continuous improvement.


### 2) Deliverables

Artifact‑first deliverables are plain‑text files committed to version control and exchanged across teams/systems:

- **sec_findings.yaml**: Normalized security findings and metadata for a cycle.
- **policy_map.md**: Human‑readable map of policies/rules to products/streams with tags.
- **exceptions.md**: Governance exceptions (approved, scoped, time‑boxed) with YAML front matter.
- **handoff_manifest.yaml**: Immutable, sealed manifest listing artifacts, checksums, and gate results.
- **digest.md**: Cycle digest with KPIs, gate outcomes, and action items.

Recommended locations and naming:

- `reports/security/<cycle>/sec_findings.yaml`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/policy_map.md`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/exceptions.md`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`


### 3) Events & Gates

Event lifecycle and required gates at each transition:

1. **PLANNED** → **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**
   - Gates: schema_lint (draft artifacts), cross_stream_consistency (tags/severity normalization), parity/coverage baseline defined
2. **READY_FOR_HANDOFF** → **PACKAGED**
   - Gates: schema_lint (all artifacts), cross_stream_consistency (streams aligned), parity/coverage threshold ≥ target
3. **PACKAGED** → **EXECUTED**
   - Gates: handoff_manifest.yaml constructed and sealed (checksums + snapshot_rev + rulebook_hash)
4. **EXECUTED** → **VALIDATED**
   - Gates: Critical=0 at handoff, exception registry referenced for any overrides, evidence attached
5. **VALIDATED** → **IMPROVE**
   - Gates: digest.md published with KPIs, remediation plan logged, improvement items triaged

Gate definitions:

- **schema_lint**: Validate artifacts against schemas; fail on unknown required fields, type mismatches, or missing IDs.
- **cross_stream_consistency**: Ensure severity normalization, tag vocabulary, and policy mappings are consistent across app/infra/data streams.
- **parity/coverage**: Verify rule/policy parity across languages/streams and minimum coverage for assets in scope.


### 4) Workflow

End‑to‑end workflow aligned to the lifecycle:

1. **Plan (PLANNED)**
   - Define scope, assets, and rulebook revision to use.
   - Initialize empty `sec_findings.yaml` draft; draft `policy_map.md` and `exceptions.md`.
   - Run schema_lint and cross_stream_consistency on drafts.

2. **Handoff Prep (READY_FOR_HANDOFF)**
   - Populate `sec_findings.yaml` with normalized findings.
   - Finalize `policy_map.md` mappings and `exceptions.md` entries.
   - Re‑run schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage; record results.

3. **Package (PACKAGED)**
   - Create `handoff_manifest.yaml` with checksums for all artifacts, snapshot_rev (e.g., VCS commit), rulebook_hash (hash of policy/rule set).
   - Seal manifest (set sealed=true) and optionally cryptographically sign.

4. **Execute (EXECUTED)**
   - Consume artifacts downstream (e.g., CI/CD, GRC, SIEM), execute validations, collect evidence.

5. **Validate (VALIDATED)**
   - Enforce Critical=0 rule; only exceptions explicitly listed in `exceptions.md` may waive non‑critical gates.
   - Attach evidence and adjudicate findings; update statuses.

6. **Improve (IMPROVE)**
   - Publish `digest.md` with KPIs and gate outcomes.
   - File remediation items; adjust policy_map or rulebook for gaps.


### 5) Handoff & Sealing

The handoff is immutably sealed using `handoff_manifest.yaml`:

- Contains: artifact file paths, sha256 checksums, `snapshot_rev`, `rulebook_hash`, gate outcomes, `critical_zero_pass`, exception summary, `sealed` flag.
- Immutable rule: Any content change requires a new cycle ID and a new sealed manifest.
- Optional: Signature fields (`signed_by`, `signature`, `key_id`) for additional integrity.

Example `handoff_manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
cycle_id: 2025-09-02
created_at: 2025-09-02T00:00:00Z
produced_by: security_framework@v1
snapshot_rev: "git:7f1c2e9"
rulebook_hash: "sha256:beef..."
artifacts:
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/sec_findings.yaml
    sha256: "..."
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/policy_map.md
    sha256: "..."
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/exceptions.md
    sha256: "..."
gates:
  schema_lint: pass
  cross_stream_consistency: pass
  parity_coverage:
    status: pass
    coverage_pct: 92
critical_zero_pass: true
exceptions:
  total: 2
  open: 2
  expiring_next_30d: 1
sealed: true

# Optional cryptographic sealing
signature:
  key_id: "kms:projects/.../keys/..."
  signed_by: security-bot@company.com
  signature: "base64..."
```


### 6) Governance Integration

- **tags[] vocabulary**: Standard tags applied to findings and policies: `PII`, `auth`, `license`, `crypto`, `secrets`, `network`, `appsec`, `infra`, `data`, `compliance`, `privacy`, `availability`, `integrity`, `confidentiality`.
- **Critical=0 rule**: At handoff, no Critical‑severity findings are permitted. Transition to VALIDATED fails if any Critical exists without a time‑boxed, approved exception (not recommended).
- **Exception registry**: All exceptions must be listed in `exceptions.md` with owner, scope, justification, expiry, ticket, and review cadence. Expired exceptions automatically invalidate handoff.

`exceptions.md` structure (YAML front matter + body):

```markdown
---
schema_version: 1
cycle_id: 2025-09-02
registry:
  - exception_id: EX-2025-001
    title: Temporary waiver for third‑party SCA medium alerts
    owner: team-appsec
    scope:
      service: payments-api
      tags: [license]
      applies_to_findings: [F-1234, F-5678]
    justification: Vendor patch pending; risk accepted for 14 days.
    expires_on: 2025-09-16
    ticket: SEC-8123
    approved_by: ciso@company.com
    status: approved
  - exception_id: EX-2025-002
    title: Auth rate‑limit threshold gap
    owner: team-platform
    scope:
      asset: edge-gateway
      tags: [auth]
    justification: Control redesign in progress.
    expires_on: 2025-10-01
    ticket: SEC-8199
    approved_by: deputy-ciso@company.com
    status: approved
---

Exceptions are time‑boxed and must be re‑approved upon expiry.
```


### 7) Metrics & Digest

KPIs form a metrics spine and feed `digest.md` each cycle:

- **Gate pass rate**: % cycles with all gates passing on first attempt
- **Critical findings count**: Must be zero at handoff
- **Exception debt**: Count and aging of open exceptions
- **Coverage parity**: Rule/policy coverage across streams (% parity)
- **MTTR for High findings**: Days to remediate high‑severity items
- **Rule drift**: Difference between `rulebook_hash` across cycles
- **Change failure rate**: % handoffs requiring re‑packaging
- **Time to validate**: Duration between EXECUTED and VALIDATED

`digest.md` structure:

```markdown
### Cycle Digest — 2025-09-02

- **Cycle ID**: 2025-09-02
- **Snapshot Rev**: git:7f1c2e9
- **Rulebook Hash**: sha256:beef...

#### Gate Results
- **schema_lint**: pass
- **cross_stream_consistency**: pass
- **parity/coverage**: 92% (target ≥ 90%) — pass
- **Critical=0**: pass

#### KPIs
- **Gate pass rate (rolling 4)**: 75% → 100%
- **Critical findings**: 0
- **Exception debt**: 2 open (1 expiring in 30 days)
- **Coverage parity**: App 94%, Infra 90%, Data 92%
- **MTTR (High)**: 9.2 days
- **Rule drift**: unchanged

#### Actions
- **Remediate**: SCA license issues in payments‑api (SEC-8123)
- **Improve**: Align Data stream auth rules with App stream
```


### 8) Acceptance Criteria

- **Lifecycle**: All six states implemented with auditable transitions.
- **Gates**: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage enforced; failures block transitions.
- **Manifest**: `handoff_manifest.yaml` includes checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, gate results, sealed flag.
- **Governance**: tags[] vocabulary enforced; Critical=0 rule at handoff; `exceptions.md` validated and time‑boxed.
- **Artifacts**: `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`, `digest.md` present and schema‑valid.
- **Metrics**: `digest.md` produced per cycle with KPIs and action items.


### 9) Risks & Mitigations

- **Over‑blocking releases**: Gates may block delivery.
  - Mitigate with risk‑scoped exceptions, clear SLOs, and staged rollout.
- **Tag inconsistency**: Divergent tag usage across teams.
  - Mitigate with a controlled vocabulary and linting.
- **Rulebook drift**: Unsynchronized rule updates.
  - Mitigate with rulebook_hash pinning and change review.
- **Exception creep**: Growing exception debt.
  - Mitigate with expiry enforcement and executive review.
- **Data sprawl**: Artifacts scattered across repos.
  - Mitigate with central index and manifest sealing.


### 10) Timeline & Next Steps

Phased delivery over four weeks:

- **Week 1**: Define schemas; implement schema_lint; establish tags[] vocabulary; enforce Critical=0 at handoff.
- **Week 2**: Build cross_stream_consistency checks; draft policy_map.md; pilot in one app stream.
- **Week 3**: Implement parity/coverage calculations; produce first `handoff_manifest.yaml` and sealed handoff.
- **Week 4**: Automate digest generation; publish `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`; start continuous improvement loop.

Immediate next steps:

- Create initial artifact templates for `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, and `handoff_manifest.yaml`.
- Stand up linting and consistency checks in CI.
- Publish first `digest.md` using the metrics spine.
