# GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_vNext.md

## Executive summary
- All four frameworks aligned to lifecycle PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE with explicit gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage).
- All manifests standardized to include snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[]; sealed with checksums; no mixed snapshots across frameworks.
- Security: new findings registry enforces Critical=0; waiver schema includes rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, compensating controls.
- Planning: FE/BE manifest path bases aligned; manifests augmented with snapshot_rev and governance.fields[]; sealed.
- QA: compliance_map added; parity/coverage and cross-stream consistency gates declared; sealed handoff manifest includes governance.tags[].
- Observability: per-cycle digest includes Gate Evidence sections (logs, metrics, validation results) and MTTA/MTTR, incident summaries; sealed observability manifest added.
- Memory spine: all framework digests are collected into /workspace/memory-bank/digests/<cycle>/ for executive rollups.
- CI/CD: governance workflow validates manifests, enforces Critical=0, and blocks release on any unresolved Critical.
- Snapshot integrity: a single snapshot_rev (git:abcdef1234 placeholder) is used across Security, Planning (FE/BE), QA, and Observability stubs.
- Readiness: NO-GO until Observability digests include attached gate evidence (not placeholders) and CI proves gates pass on sealed artifacts.

## Per-framework findings after applying the checklist

### Security
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/findings.yaml capturing Critical=0 and governance.tags[].
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.yaml with rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, compensating_controls.
  - Updated /workspace/frameworks/security/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml to include governance.tags[] with rationale + expiry; ensured snapshot_rev and rulebook_hash present; sealed.
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/security/rules/release_gates.yaml to block release if any Critical unresolved.
- What remains:
  - Populate real findings; if Critical detected, add time-bounded exceptions with compensating controls.
  - Execute CI gates and attach evidence into Observability digest.

### Planning (FE/BE)
- What changed:
  - Aligned manifest path bases to /workspace/frameworks/planning-fe/manifests/ and /workspace/frameworks/planning-be/manifests/.
  - Added snapshot_rev and governance.fields[] to all planning manifests; sealed with checksums and rulebook_hash.
- What remains:
  - Confirm governance.fields[] values (owners, risk, compliance) and run cross_stream_consistency against QA mappings.

### QA
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/artifacts/2025-09/compliance_map.md (schema coverage map).
  - Declared automated gates (schema_lint, parity/coverage, cross_stream_consistency) in /workspace/frameworks/qa-test/rules/gates.yaml.
  - Ensured sealed QA handoff manifest includes governance.tags[] and single snapshot_rev.
- What remains:
  - Record actual coverage metrics and evidence links; integrate with Observability gate evidence.

### Observability
- What changed:
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/observability/digests/2025-09-02-digest.md with KPI sections (MTTA/MTTR, incidents) and Gate Evidence sections (logs, metrics, validation).
  - Added /workspace/frameworks/observability/manifests/2025-09/handoff_manifest.yaml; sealed with snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, governance.tags[].
- What remains:
  - Attach concrete evidence artifacts (log excerpts, metric snapshots, CI validation outputs) and hash them into the manifest.

## Cross-framework integration map
- Planning-FE/BE → QA:
  - Producers: planning manifests and backlogs at /workspace/frameworks/planning-*/.
  - Consumers: QA test_matrix and compliance_map align story_ref/endpoint_ref for parity and cross-stream consistency.
- Security → Observability:
  - Producers: /workspace/frameworks/security/findings.yaml and exceptions.yaml.
  - Consumers: Observability digest Gate Evidence includes security gate results; CI release gate enforces Critical=0.
- QA → Observability:
  - Producers: sealed QA handoff manifest and artifacts (test_matrix, evidence index).
  - Consumers: Observability digest ingests gate outcomes and references evidence.
- All frameworks → Memory Bank:
  - Producers: per-cycle digests from QA, Security, Planning, Observability.
  - Consumer: /workspace/memory-bank/digests/<cycle>/ for executive roll-ups and audits.
- CI/CD:
  - Triggers on changes under /workspace/frameworks/**; runs schema_lint, consistency, parity; generates/validates sealed manifests; blocks on Critical>0.

## Final readiness decision: NO-GO
- Security Critical=0: Pass (design artifacts support Critical=0; actual finding status to be validated on CI).
- Snapshot integrity: Pass (single snapshot_rev across all stubs).
- QA gates: Declared but unproven (need CI results and evidence artifacts).
- Observability digests: Gate Evidence sections present but evidence not yet attached. Decision remains NO-GO until evidence is attached and CI gates pass on sealed manifests.
