### 1) Executive Summary

This document proposes a complete, artifact-first Observability & Monitoring framework module designed to be portable, auditable, and automation-friendly. The framework centers on declarative YAML/MD/JSON artifacts as the single source of truth, governed by a strict event lifecycle and quality gates to ensure consistency, parity, and coverage across logs, metrics, and alerts. An immutable handoff manifest seals each delivery with checksums and snapshot metadata, while a governance overlay enforces policy via tags and a Critical=0 rule. A metrics spine comprising explicit KPIs and a per-cycle digest provides longitudinal visibility and continuous improvement signals.

Outcomes:
- **Artifact-first interop**: Standardized YAML/MD/JSON artifacts enable CI/CD validation, diffability, and cross-tool interop.
- **Event lifecycle**: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE.
- **Quality gates**: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage.
- **Immutable handoff**: Manifest with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- **Governance overlay**: tags[] taxonomy + enforced Critical=0 policy.
- **Metrics spine**: KPI catalog and a digest file emitted each cycle.

### 2) Deliverables

Artifact names and intents. All artifacts are immutable once sealed in a handoff.

- **logs_index.yaml**: Canonical index of log streams and their schemas.
  - Purpose: Describe producers, retention, PII flags, schema versions.
  - Owners: Platform Observability + Service Teams.
  - Location: repo `frameworks/observability/`.
  - Example shape:

```yaml
version: 1
streams:
  - name: payments_api.access
    owner: team-payments
    retention_days: 30
    pii: false
    schema_version: 3
    schema: 
      - field: timestamp
        type: datetime
      - field: status_code
        type: int
      - field: latency_ms
        type: int
      - field: route
        type: string
    tags: [service:payments, tier:backend]
```

- **metrics_catalog.yaml**: Authoritative metrics/KPIs catalog and derivations.
  - Purpose: Define metrics, units, SLO/SLA bindings, owners, and derivations.
  - Example shape:

```yaml
version: 1
metrics:
  - name: payments.request_rate
    type: counter
    unit: rps
    owner: team-payments
    description: Incoming requests per second
    kpi: true
    slo:
      objective: 99.9
      window: 30d
    tags: [service:payments, tier:backend]
  - name: payments.error_rate
    type: ratio
    numerator: payments.errors
    denominator: payments.request_rate
    unit: pct
    kpi: true
    slo:
      objective: 99.9
      window: 30d
    tags: [service:payments, tier:backend]
```

- **alert_rules.md**: Human-readable rulebook for alerts derived from metrics.
  - Purpose: Explain intent and policy of alerts in plain language with links to metric IDs; supports governance review.
  - Example excerpt:

```md
## Alert: Payments Elevated Error Rate
- metric: payments.error_rate
- severity: critical
- condition: error_rate > 1% for 5m
- runbook: link://runbook/payments-error-burst
- tags: [service:payments, Critical:0, owner:team-payments]
```

- **handoff_manifest.yaml**: Immutable sealed manifest of a delivery.
  - Purpose: Record exact artifact checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and seal metadata.
  - Example shape:

```yaml
version: 1
snapshot_rev: main@abc1234
rulebook_hash: sha256:2b4f...9e
artifacts:
  - path: logs_index.yaml
    checksum: sha256:1a2b...ff
  - path: metrics_catalog.yaml
    checksum: sha256:3c4d...aa
  - path: alert_rules.md
    checksum: sha256:5e6f...bb
quality_gates:
  schema_lint: pass
  cross_stream_consistency: pass
  parity_coverage: pass
sealed_by: ci@observability-bot
sealed_at: 2025-09-02T00:00:00Z
```

- **digest.md**: Per-cycle operational digest tied to the sealed manifest.
  - Purpose: Summarize KPI performance, coverage parity, drift, hot alerts, and improvement actions.

---

### 3) Events & Gates

Lifecycle states and required quality gates:

- **PLANNED**
  - Entry: Design intent captured; Jira/issue link.
  - Exit: Draft artifacts exist; preliminary governance tags assigned.
  - Gates: none (advisory reviews only).

- **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**
  - Entry: Draft artifacts complete; schema owners identified; runbooks referenced.
  - Exit: All quality gates passing in CI; reviewers sign-off.
  - Gates: schema_lint (required), cross_stream_consistency (required), parity/coverage (required).

- **PACKAGED**
  - Entry: Artifacts versioned; CHANGELOG updated; candidate manifest assembled.
  - Exit: Immutable handoff manifest generated with checksums.
  - Gates: Re-run all gates against packaged artifacts.

- **EXECUTED**
  - Entry: Handoff applied to tooling (pipelines/alerting/dashboards) from manifest.
  - Exit: Deployment evidence captured; success criteria observed.
  - Gates: Runtime verification (e.g., alerts exist and fire in synthetic tests).

- **VALIDATED**
  - Entry: Runtime behavior matches intent; KPIs visible and alertable.
  - Exit: Digest for cycle published and linked to manifest.
  - Gates: Post-deploy checks; owner ACK.

- **IMPROVE**
  - Entry: Action items from digest tracked; backlog items created.
  - Exit: Improvements scheduled; feedback loop closed.
  - Gates: none mandatory; advisory governance checks.

Gate definitions:
- **schema_lint**: YAML schema validation for `logs_index.yaml`, `metrics_catalog.yaml`, `alert_rules.md` (structure blocks), and manifest shape.
- **cross_stream_consistency**: Naming conventions, tag taxonomy adherence, unit normalization, label cardinality thresholds.
- **parity/coverage**: Every KPI has associated alert(s), dashboard views, and runbook links; across services parity for severities and thresholds.

---

### 4) Workflow

1. Author artifacts (YAML/MD) in feature branch; add governance `tags[]` and owners.
2. Open PR → CI runs gates: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage.
3. Reviewers approve; state advances to READY_FOR_HANDOFF.
4. CI packages artifacts; computes checksums; generates `handoff_manifest.yaml` → PACKAGED.
5. Apply from manifest to target systems; capture execution evidence → EXECUTED.
6. Perform runtime validation, synthetic alert tests; publish `digest.md` tied to manifest → VALIDATED.
7. File improvement items; schedule follow-ups → IMPROVE.

Roles:
- DRI Service Owner: Authors metrics/alerts; owns runbooks.
- Observability Platform: Maintains gates, schemas, packaging.
- Governance/Compliance: Reviews tags, policy adherence.

Tooling:
- CI pipeline with linters, schema validators, and consistency checks.
- Hashing: SHA256 over canonicalized artifact content.
- Storage: Git repo (source of truth); artifact registry mirror (optional).

---

### 5) Handoff & Sealing

- **Immutability**: Once `handoff_manifest.yaml` is sealed, referenced artifact bytes are immutable. Changes require a new manifest and snapshot_rev.
- **Checksums**: SHA256 computed over normalized (UTF-8, LF) content; recorded per artifact.
- **snapshot_rev**: SCM ref (branch@commit) capturing repo state used for packaging.
- **rulebook_hash**: SHA256 hash of `alert_rules.md` content after normalization.
- **Seal metadata**: `sealed_by`, `sealed_at`, CI build ID.
- **Verification**: `verify-manifest` job re-hashes bytes post-deploy and compares to manifest.
- **Retention**: Manifests retained ≥ 18 months with artifact bytes.

---

### 6) Governance Integration

- **tags[] taxonomy**: `service`, `owner`, `tier`, `environment`, `data_class`, `region`, `Critical`.
- **Critical=0 rule**: No artifact may set `Critical:1` (or higher) unless an exception ticket is approved. Default is `Critical:0`. CI blocks violations.
- **Policy overlays**:
  - Require `owner` and `service` tags on all metrics and alerts.
  - Enforce severity to actionability mapping (e.g., critical requires runbook).
  - Enforce label cardinality ceilings.
- **Exceptions**: Tracked via ticket ID in `tags[]` (e.g., `policy_exception:JIRA-1234`) with expiration.

---

### 7) Metrics & Digest

- **KPI spine**: Subset of metrics marked `kpi: true` in `metrics_catalog.yaml`.
- **Coverage model**: For each KPI → alerts (≥1), SLO binding, dashboard panel, and runbook link.
- **Digest cadence**: Published per release cycle (weekly/bi-weekly), named `YYYY-MM-DD-digest.md` and linked to the manifest.
- **Digest contents**:
  - Cycle metadata (window, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash).
  - KPI summary table (current vs prior, SLO compliance, trend).
  - Coverage parity status and debt log.
  - Drift findings (schema, thresholds, cardinality).
  - Hot alerts and MTTR/MTTA.
  - Improvement actions with owners and due dates.

Template block for digest entries:

```md
## Cycle YYYY-MM-DD
- snapshot_rev: <branch@commit>
- rulebook_hash: sha256:...
- manifest_checksum: sha256:...

### KPI Summary
| KPI | Current | Prior | SLO | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| payments.error_rate | 0.6% | 0.9% | 99.9 | ✅ |

### Coverage & Parity
- KPIs: 10; Alerts: 10/10; Dashboards: 10/10; Runbooks: 10/10 → ✅

### Drift & Hygiene
- No schema drifts detected; label cardinality within thresholds.

### Hot Alerts
- payments.error_rate spikes (2 incidents); MTTA 3m; MTTR 18m.

### Actions
- Lower warning threshold for latency; Owner: team-payments; Due: 2025-09-09.
```

---

### 8) Acceptance Criteria

- Artifacts (`logs_index.yaml`, `metrics_catalog.yaml`, `alert_rules.md`) lint clean and pass cross_stream_consistency and parity/coverage checks in CI.
- `handoff_manifest.yaml` generated with non-empty checksums, snapshot_rev, and rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay enforced, with Critical=0 as default and policy violations blocked in CI.
- A sample cycle `digest.md` produced and linked to the sealed manifest.
- Documentation includes workflow, roles, and operating procedures for each state.

---

### 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Schema drift across services → Mitigation: automated diff alerts, schema freeze windows.
- Risk: Alert fatigue → Mitigation: parity/coverage includes noise budget scoring; governance requires runbooks for high severity.
- Risk: Label cardinality explosions → Mitigation: pre-merge cardinality estimation and runtime guardrails.
- Risk: Process friction slows teams → Mitigation: templates, generators, and clear owner assignments reduce toil.
- Risk: Partial adoption → Mitigation: Critical=0 default with progressive enforcement and exception process.

---

### 10) Timeline & Next Steps

Proposed 4-week rollout from 2025-09-02:

- Week 1: Finalize schemas, implement linters, scaffold artifacts and CI gating.
- Week 2: Implement packaging and manifest sealing; enable governance overlay.
- Week 3: Wire deployment execution and runtime verification; pilot with payments.
- Week 4: Produce first digest; iterate based on pilot feedback; expand to 2nd service.

Immediate next steps:
- Approve this design.
- Stand up CI jobs for gates.
- Author initial `logs_index.yaml`, `metrics_catalog.yaml`, `alert_rules.md` for one service.
- Implement manifest sealing and verification jobs.
