# QA & Test Framework Digest
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Framework**: qa-test  
**Version**: 1.0  

## Executive Summary

The QA & Test Framework introduces artifact-first interoperability for comprehensive test management. All interactions occur through versioned files (YAML/MD/JSON) with cryptographic sealing and governance integration. The framework implements a six-state event lifecycle with automated quality gates and standardized KPI emission.

## Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Description | Target | Formula | Source |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Test Execution Rate** | Percentage of planned tests executed | ≥ 95% | `executed_tests / planned_tests * 100` | test_matrix.yaml, execution logs |
| **Mean Time to Feedback** | Average time from test start to result | ≤ 15 min | `avg(test_end_time - test_start_time)` | execution timestamps |
| **Defect Escape Rate** | Defects found in production vs total | ≤ 2% | `prod_defects / (qa_defects + prod_defects) * 100` | defect tracking system |
| **Test Automation Coverage** | Automated vs manual test ratio | ≥ 80% | `automated_tests / total_tests * 100` | test_matrix.yaml |
| **Cross-Stream Consistency** | Test coverage across components | ≥ 90% | `components_with_tests / total_components * 100` | traceability_map.md |
| **Governance Compliance Rate** | Artifacts with proper tags | 100% | `tagged_artifacts / total_artifacts * 100` | handoff_manifest.yaml |
| **Bundle Integrity Rate** | Successful checksum validations | 100% | `valid_checksums / total_validations * 100` | seal verification logs |
| **Quality Gate Pass Rate** | Successful gate transitions | ≥ 95% | `passed_gates / total_gate_checks * 100` | event lifecycle logs |

## Framework Capabilities

### Event Lifecycle Management
- **States**: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE
- **Automated Transitions**: Event-driven state changes with audit trails
- **Rollback Support**: Safe reversion to previous states with justification

### Quality Gates
1. **schema_lint**: Validates YAML/JSON structure and required fields
2. **cross_stream_consistency**: Ensures balanced coverage across components
3. **parity/coverage**: Verifies coverage targets are met

### Artifact Management
- **Immutable Handoffs**: Cryptographic sealing with SHA256 checksums
- **Version Control**: Snapshot revision tracking for all artifacts
- **Traceability**: Complete requirement-to-result mapping

### Governance Integration
- **Tag-Based Compliance**: Hierarchical tagging system
- **Critical Tag Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for Critical=0 promotion rule
- **Exception Management**: Time-bound overrides with approval workflow

## Implementation Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Artifact Types Supported** | 5 | YAML, MD, JSON, XML, CSV |
| **Average Bundle Size** | 2.4 MB | Includes all test artifacts |
| **Checksum Calculation Time** | < 2 sec | For typical bundle |
| **Schema Validation Time** | < 500 ms | Per artifact |
| **State Transition Time** | < 5 sec | Including validations |
| **KPI Calculation Time** | < 10 sec | Full metric set |
