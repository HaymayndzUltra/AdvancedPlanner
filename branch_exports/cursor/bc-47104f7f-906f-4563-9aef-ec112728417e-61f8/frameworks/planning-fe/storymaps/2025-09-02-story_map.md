# Planning FE - Story Map (2025-09-02)

## Epic: Planning Lifecycle (Frontend)

### Backbone (User Activities)
1. Plan Scope → 2. Validate & Freeze → 3. Handoff → 4. Execute → 5. Validate → 6. Improve

### Walking Skeleton (MVP)
- Draft `fe_task_breakdown.yaml`
- Draft `story_map.md`
- Run schema lint and cross-stream checks
- Generate `handoff_manifest.yaml`
- Publish cycle digest

### Release 1 Slices
- Gate automation and governance overlay
- Manifest sealing and publication
- Metrics spine and digest automation

## Story Slices

- SM-01: Author and validate planning artifacts
- SM-02: Integrate quality gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency)
- SM-03: Handoff manifest generation and sealing
- SM-04: Digest generation and improvement actions

## Acceptance

- All artifacts comply with schemas
- Gates pass before sealing
- Manifest includes checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash
- Critical=0 governance satisfied
- Digest published with KPIs and actions
