### 1) Executive Summary (Release Management Framework)

What: A Release Management framework that orchestrates end-to-end releases across FE, BE, QA, and UX using artifact-first interop, immutable handoffs, and strict, append-only event lifecycle.

Why: Ensure every release is governed, consistent across streams, sealed with manifest and checksums, and promoted only when global gates pass and Critical findings are zero.

Goals:
- Ensure cross-stream mapping completeness and parity targets before release.
- Enforce immutable, reproducible handoffs with manifest integrity.
- Codify governance overlays and exception handling.
- Provide a metrics spine and minimal one-page digest for human-in-the-loop decisions.

Assumptions:
- Default parity target for cross-stream mapping is 0.95 (95%).
- Critical findings threshold is 0; exceptions require approval and expiry.
- Event lifecycle is append-only: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE.

### 3) Events & Gates (produced/consumed; gate criteria; pass/fail)

Produced Events (append-only):
- PLANNED(release-mgmt, rev): initial `release_plan.yaml` exists and schema_lint PASS
- READY_FOR_HANDOFF(release-mgmt, rev): all gates PASS; handoff_manifest prepared
- PACKAGED(release-mgmt, rev): manifest sealed with checksums
- EXECUTED(release-mgmt, rev): release applied to target env(s)
- VALIDATED(release-mgmt, rev): post-deploy checks/QA validation PASS
- IMPROVE(release-mgmt, rev): retro actions captured and assigned

Consumed Events:
- PLANNED from planning-fe and planning-be (to import story_ref, endpoint_ref)
- READY_FOR_HANDOFF from qa-test/security (to ensure readiness/parity)
- VALIDATED from qa-test (for post-deploy confirmation)

Gates (fail-fast, global):
- schema_lint: All MUST fields present on `release_plan.yaml`, `rollback_catalog.yaml`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`.
  - PASS: schemas conform
  - FAIL: missing/invalid fields
- cross_stream_consistency: Mappings satisfy kernel rules
  - FE story_ref ↔ BE item/endpoint_ref: all referenced IDs exist upstream
  - BE endpoint_ref ↔ QA test_ref (contract/e2e): tests exist for changed endpoints
  - Any data touchpoint ↔ governance.tags include PII/auth/retention where applicable
  - UI change ↔ UX component/token_ref present
  - Release item ↔ rollback_ref present and valid
  - PASS: 100% referential integrity
  - FAIL: any missing mapping
- parity/coverage:
  - cross_stream_parity = mapped_refs / total_refs ≥ 0.95 (default target)
  - endpoint_test_parity = tested_endpoints / changed_endpoints ≥ 0.90
  - critical_path coverage = 1.0 for items marked critical_path
  - PASS: all thresholds met
  - FAIL: any threshold unmet


### 4) Workflow (inputs → process → outputs; handoff points)

Inputs:
- planning/frontend `fe_task_breakdown.yaml` (story_ref)
- planning/backend `be_backlog.yaml` (item/endpoint_ref)
- qa-test `test_matrix.yaml` (test_ref)
- design system tokens/components
- governance policy catalog (tags, rules)

Process:
1) Ingest upstream artifacts; build unified cross_stream_map.
2) Draft `release_plan.yaml` components[] using upstream refs and assign rollback_ref per item.
3) Generate `cross_stream_map.md`; highlight gaps.
4) Run gates in order: schema_lint → cross_stream_consistency → parity/coverage.
5) If PASS, compile `handoff_manifest.yaml` with checksums (artifact-first). Emit READY_FOR_HANDOFF.
6) Seal manifest to emit PACKAGED. Prepare `release_notes.md`.
7) Execute release per `release_plan.yaml` target_window; emit EXECUTED.
8) Collect post-deploy validation (QA/monitoring); emit VALIDATED.
9) Produce digest for the cycle and improvement actions; emit IMPROVE.

Outputs:
- `release_plan.yaml`, `cross_stream_map.md`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`, `release_notes.md`, `YYYYMMDD-digest.md`.

Handoff:
- Handoff occurs between steps 5 and 6 (READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED) using sealed manifest.


### 5) Handoff & Sealing (manifest contents; READY_FOR_HANDOFF; snapshot rule)

READY_FOR_HANDOFF when:
- schema_lint PASS for all artifacts
- cross_stream_consistency PASS (no missing refs)
- parity/coverage PASS vs targets
- policy_exceptions.md reviewed; Critical findings count = 0 or approved exception present
- handoff_manifest.yaml drafted with checksums

Manifest contents:
- release_id, framework_rev
- artifacts[] with {path, checksum_sha256}
- snapshot_rev
- rulebook_hash
- owners, timestamps

Snapshot rule:
- If any artifact in the handoff has a different snapshot_rev → BLOCK (no handoff).


### 6) Governance Integration (tags emitted; exceptions; Critical=0)

Governance tags emitted:
- auth, PII, retention, license, availability, sox

Exceptions registry:
- File: `/frameworks/release-mgmt/reports/policy_exceptions.md`
- Format: {rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, scope_ref}

Critical=0 rule:
- Before promotion, Critical findings must be zero. If not, BLOCK unless an approved exception exists with non-expired `expiry` and clear `rationale`.


### 7) Metrics & Digest (KPIs; digest contents/path)

KPIs (name, formula, source, window):
- release_parity = mapped_refs / total_refs (source: cross_stream_map.md) window: per cycle
- endpoint_test_parity = tested_endpoints / changed_endpoints (source: qa-test matrix) window: per cycle
- rollback_readiness = valid_rollback_refs / total_release_items (source: release_plan.yaml, rollback_catalog.yaml) window: per cycle
- change_failure_rate = failed_releases / total_releases (source: incidents/deploy logs) window: trailing 30 days
- lead_time = executed_at − planned_at (source: manifest timestamps) window: per cycle
- time_to_restore = mean_time_to_restore (source: incident postmortems) window: trailing 90 days

Digest file:
- Path: `/frameworks/release-mgmt/digests/YYYYMMDD-digest.md`
- Contents: TL;DR, gates status, KPI table, top risks/gaps, exceptions, snapshot_rev, manifest hash, go/no-go statement.


### 8) Acceptance Criteria (binary, testable)

- schema_lint: PASS for `release_plan.yaml`, `rollback_catalog.yaml`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`
- cross_stream_consistency: 100% referential integrity across FE/BE/QA/UX and rollback
- parity/coverage: release_parity ≥ 0.95; endpoint_test_parity ≥ 0.90; critical_path coverage = 1.0
- handoff_manifest.yaml present; checksums computed for all artifacts
- snapshot_rev consistent across all artifacts (no mixed snapshots)
- governance: Critical=0 or approved, non-expired exception
- digest published at `/frameworks/release-mgmt/digests/<date>-digest.md`


### 9) Risks & Mitigations (concrete)

- Risk: Mixed snapshot_rev across artifacts
  - Mitigation: Pre-handoff snapshot audit; block on mismatch
- Risk: Incomplete cross-stream mappings (late stories/endpoints/tests)
  - Mitigation: Gap dashboard in cross_stream_map; handoff BLOCK for P0 gaps
- Risk: Manual error in rollback procedures
  - Mitigation: Verification_ref + dry-run in stage; include estimated_time_min checks
- Risk: Gate over-blocking urgent hotfixes
  - Mitigation: Exception path with limited expiry and explicit approver; post-hoc review
- Risk: Drift between release_notes and actual contents
  - Mitigation: Auto-generate notes from manifest and mappings; checksums as source of truth


### 10) Timeline & Next Steps (earliest checkpoint artifact)

- Day 0.5: Draft `release_plan.yaml`; schema_lint PASS → emit PLANNED
- Day 1.0: Build cross_stream_map + parity calc + digest v1
- Day 1.5: Seal `handoff_manifest.yaml`; emit READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED
- Day 2.0: Execute release window; collect validation → EXECUTED → VALIDATED
- Day 2.5: Publish IMPROVE actions; finalize digest

Blocking Q (assumption used): parity target = 0.95; endpoint_test_parity target = 0.90.
