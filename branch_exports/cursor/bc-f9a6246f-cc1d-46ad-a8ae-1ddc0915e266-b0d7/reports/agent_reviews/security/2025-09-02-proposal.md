# Security & Compliance Framework Module — Design Proposal

- Date: 2025-09-02
- Version: v0.1 (proposal)
- Owners: Security Engineering, Compliance, Platform
- Scope: Cross-repo, artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance (S&C) framework

## 1) Executive Summary

This proposal defines an artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance framework that standardizes how security findings, policies, exceptions, and handoffs are authored, validated, sealed, and measured across product streams. The design centers on machine-readable artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON) and a deterministic event lifecycle with quality gates to ensure consistency and enforce governance.

Key elements:
- Artifact-first interop: All outcomes are materialized as versioned text artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON).
- Event lifecycle: PLANNED -> READY_FOR_HANDOFF -> PACKAGED -> EXECUTED -> VALIDATED -> IMPROVE.
- Quality gates: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage.
- Immutable handoff manifest: cryptographic checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay: tags[] (PII, auth, license, etc.), Critical=0 rule, exception registry.
- Metrics spine: KPIs with a digest file per cycle for leadership and audit.

Outcomes: predictable handoffs, auditable artifacts, consistent governance, measurable performance, and continuous improvement.

## 2) Deliverables

Authoritative artifacts for each cycle (stored under repo-controlled directories, versioned in VCS):

- sec_findings.yaml: Canonical record of findings for the cycle.
- policy_map.md: Human-readable mapping from policies/controls to rules, tags, and owners.
- exceptions.md: Exception registry with approvals, scope, and expiry.
- handoff_manifest.yaml: Immutable manifest sealing the cycle handoff.
- digest.md: Metrics digest summarizing KPIs and gate outcomes.

Suggested default locations:
- Security reviews (proposal): `reports/agent_reviews/security/<date>-proposal.md`
- Findings: `frameworks/security/artifacts/<cycle>/sec_findings.yaml`
- Policy map: `frameworks/security/policy/policy_map.md`
- Exceptions: `frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.md`
- Handoff manifest: `frameworks/security/manifests/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- Digest: `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`

## 3) Events & Gates

Event lifecycle and required gates:

- PLANNED
  - Inputs: backlog, last cycle digest, policy deltas
  - Outputs: scoped plan, owners, target KPIs
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(plan artifacts)

- READY_FOR_HANDOFF
  - Inputs: draft artifacts, exception requests
  - Outputs: candidate `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(all), cross_stream_consistency

- PACKAGED
  - Inputs: frozen artifacts, reproducible build inputs
  - Outputs: pre-manifest artifact set
  - Exit gates: parity/coverage (across streams/services), schema_lint(all)

- EXECUTED
  - Inputs: packaged artifacts, automation runs
  - Outputs: evaluated findings, remediations, generated checksums
  - Exit gates: cross_stream_consistency (post-eval), schema_lint(findings)

- VALIDATED
  - Inputs: executed results, sign-offs
  - Outputs: immutable `handoff_manifest.yaml` (sealed)
  - Exit gates: Critical=0 (no Critical findings without time-bound exception), parity/coverage

- IMPROVE
  - Inputs: digest.md, retrospectives
  - Outputs: backlog updates, policy refinements
  - Exit gates: none; feeds next PLANNED

Gate definitions:
- schema_lint: Validate against JSON Schema/YAML meta-schema for all artifacts.
- cross_stream_consistency: Enforce shared constraints (e.g., severity scale, tag taxonomy, policy references) across streams.
- parity/coverage: Ensure required streams/services have artifacts; enforce coverage targets per policy.

## 4) Workflow

- Authoring
  - Security engineers author/update artifacts under `frameworks/security/...` in feature branches.
  - Use templates and schemas stored in-repo.

- Automation
  - CI runs schema_lint on every change.
  - Nightly job checks cross_stream_consistency across all active streams.
  - Release pipeline enforces parity/coverage before PACKAGED.

- Reviews & Approvals
  - PRs require code owners from Security and the relevant service team.
  - Exceptions require approver signatures embedded in `exceptions.md` and captured in manifest.

- Versioning & Traceability
  - snapshot_rev pin on VALIDATED references commit SHA for all artifacts.
  - rulebook_hash pins the evaluation ruleset (content-addressed digest of rules).
  - Checksums ensure artifact immutability at handoff.

- Storage & Retention
  - Artifacts are committed to VCS; signed manifests are retained for at least 24 months.
  - Optional offsite store mirrors sealed manifests and checksums.

## 5) Handoff & Sealing

- Assemble artifacts: `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`.
- Compute sha256 checksums over canonicalized content.
- Create `handoff_manifest.yaml` with: manifest_version, cycle, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, artifacts[], quality_gates, signing.
- Seal the handoff:
  - Write canonical file
  - Sign the manifest using organization key (Sigstore or X.509-based)
  - Store signature and signer identity in manifest
  - Treat the manifest as immutable; future changes require a superseding manifest

## 6) Governance Integration

- tags[] taxonomy: PII, auth, license, infra, crypto, logging, egress, privacy, etc.
- Critical=0 rule: VALIDATED requires zero Critical findings unless there is a time-bound, approved exception.
- Exception registry: All exceptions recorded in `exceptions.md` with scope, justification, risk, controls, approver, and expiry.

## 7) Metrics & Digest

KPIs (per cycle):
- Mean time to VALIDATED
- Gate pass rate by stage (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage)
- Open Critical at PACKAGED vs VALIDATED
- Exception count by severity and status (new/active/expired)
- Coverage parity across streams (% streams meeting required artifacts)
- Reopen rate (findings reopened after closure)

Digest file structure described in `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`.

## 8) Acceptance Criteria

- Templates and minimal schemas exist and pass schema_lint.
- Pipeline implements lifecycle states with gate checks at transitions.
- Manifest includes snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and sha256 for all artifacts.
- Governance: tag taxonomy enforced; Critical=0 rule blocks VALIDATED without approved exception.
- Digest generation job writes `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md` each cycle.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Cross-stream drift: nightly consistency checks and shared schema registry.
- Exception abuse: approval ladder, expiry, compensating controls required; surfaced in digest.
- Hash/signing errors: canonicalization, deterministic hashing, Sigstore-backed verification in CI.
- Coverage gaps: parity/coverage gate hard-fail, visible KPI in digest.

## 10) Timeline & Next Steps

- Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Define schemas and templates; implement schema_lint; establish tags[] and Critical=0 gate.
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3–4): Implement consistency and parity checks; create sealer with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and signing.
- Phase 3 (Weeks 5–6): Wire pipeline stages; generate first `digest.md`; run retrospective.

Immediate next steps:
- Create initial templates and schemas in `frameworks/security/`
- Stand up CI jobs for schema_lint and consistency checks
- Pilot on one stream (payments-service) before org-wide rollout
