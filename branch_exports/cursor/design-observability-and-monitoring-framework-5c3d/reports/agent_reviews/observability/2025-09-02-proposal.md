### 1) Executive Summary
This document proposes a complete, artifact-first Observability & Monitoring framework module optimized for multi-team interoperability and immutable, auditable delivery. It defines a strict event lifecycle (PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE), quality gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage), and an immutable handoff manifest (checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash). Governance overlays via tags[] and a Critical=0 rule enforce risk-aware controls without blocking agility. A metrics spine standardizes KPIs and produces a digest file per cycle to summarize health, drift, and improvement actions.

### 2) Deliverables
Logical artifacts and their purpose. All are designed to be authored and validated as text-first (YAML/MD/JSON) and stored in VCS.

- **logs_index.yaml**: Canonical catalog of log streams, ownership, schema, PII classification, retention, and routing.
- **metrics_catalog.yaml**: Metrics spine—authoritative list of KPIs, SLOs, labels, rollups, owners, and SLIs.
- **alert_rules.md**: Human-readable rulebook describing intent, rationale, and governance tags; references compiled alert specs.
- **handoff_manifest.yaml**: Immutable handoff metadata including checksums of all artifacts, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, quality gate results, and governance overlay.
- **digest.md**: Per-cycle executive digest of KPI status, alert parity/coverage, drift, incidents, and improvement actions.

### 3) Events & Gates
Event lifecycle, with mandatory quality gates at transitions. Artifacts are the single source of truth.

- **PLANNED**
  - Inputs: RFCs, backlog items, incident RCAs
  - Outputs: Draft updates to logs_index, metrics_catalog, alert_rules
  - Gates: schema_lint (draft), initial parity/coverage baseline

- **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**
  - Criteria: All schema_lint passing; cross_stream_consistency (IDs, owners, namespaces) green; parity/coverage targets ≥ threshold
  - Artifacts: Candidate `handoff_manifest.yaml` prepared with draft checksums

- **PACKAGED**
  - Action: Artifacts frozen; final checksums computed; snapshot_rev recorded
  - Gates: schema_lint (final), cross_stream_consistency (final), parity/coverage (final)

- **EXECUTED**
  - Action: Deployed to monitoring backends; rules loaded; dashboards synced
  - Evidence: Execution logs, deployment IDs linked in manifest

- **VALIDATED**
  - Action: Smoke validations (synthetic events, test alerts), SLO conformance checks
  - Gates: Validation pass rate ≥ threshold; zero Critical violations (see Governance)

- **IMPROVE**
  - Action: Post-cycle learnings, drift remediation, backlog seeding
  - Artifacts: `digest.md` for the cycle, improvement issues linked

### 4) Workflow
Artifact-first workflow emphasizing reproducibility and automation. All steps are CI-friendly.

1. Author changes in branches across `logs_index.yaml`, `metrics_catalog.yaml`, `alert_rules.md`.
2. Run offline gate suite:
   - schema_lint: validate YAML/MD schemas, field types, required keys.
   - cross_stream_consistency: enforce naming/namespace alignment across logs/metrics/rules.
   - parity/coverage: map rules ↔ metrics/logs; compute gaps and target coverage.
3. Prepare `handoff_manifest.yaml` with draft checksums and `snapshot_rev` referencing VCS SHA.
4. Request handoff review; apply Governance overlay (tags[], Critical=0 check) and freeze scope.
5. Seal to PACKAGED: recompute checksums; store `rulebook_hash` of `alert_rules.md`; capture gate results.
6. Execute deployment; record deployment IDs, timestamps in manifest; transition to EXECUTED.
7. Validate with synthetics and canaries; on success, mark VALIDATED; otherwise loop back.
8. Generate per-cycle `digest.md` summarizing metrics spine KPIs, alert parity, and actions; enter IMPROVE.

### 5) Handoff & Sealing
Immutable handoff ensures auditability and precise rollback.

- Manifest fields (illustrative):
  - snapshot_rev: VCS commit SHA or version tag.
  - artifacts: list with path, sha256, size_bytes, content_type.
  - rulebook_hash: sha256 of normalized `alert_rules.md`.
  - quality_gates: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage (status, details, timestamp).
  - governance: tags[], `critical_rule_violation_count`.
  - execution: deployment_id, environment, applied_at, executor.
  - validation: test_matrix, pass_rate, failures, validated_at.
- Sealing rules:
  - Handoff manifest is immutable post-PACKAGED; any change requires a new snapshot_rev.
  - All checksums must be reproducible from VCS contents.

### 6) Governance Integration
Policy overlay applied consistently across artifacts.

- tags[]: domain, data_classification, oncall_team, service_tier, compliance.
- Critical=0 rule: A release cannot be VALIDATED if any Critical rule fails or any artifact is tagged `critical=true` with an open violation. The manifest records the count and blocker rationale.
- Approvals: Codeowner approvals for domain owners; auditors can verify via manifest invariants.

### 7) Metrics & Digest
Metrics spine and digest ensure signal quality and executive visibility.

- KPIs & SLOs: Defined in `metrics_catalog.yaml` with semantic names, units, objectives, breakdown labels, rollup windows, and owners.
- Digest file per cycle (`digest.md`):
  - KPI snapshot: last cycle value, delta vs target, trend.
  - Alert parity/coverage: % metrics with guarding rules; drift from prior cycle.
  - Incidents & noise: MTTA/MTTR, false-positive rate, silences.
  - Improvements: committed actions, owners, due dates.
  - Governance: Critical=0 confirmation, gate statuses, snapshot_rev.

### 8) Acceptance Criteria
- All five artifacts exist and validate against published schemas.
- Event lifecycle transitions are recorded with passing gate evidence in manifest.
- Handoff manifest is immutable post-PACKAGED with reproducible checksums, `snapshot_rev`, and `rulebook_hash`.
- Governance overlay applied, `critical_rule_violation_count == 0` at VALIDATED.
- Metrics digest generated each cycle with KPI, parity/coverage, and improvement items.

### 9) Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Schema creep and drift across teams.
  - Mitigation: Central schemas, CI gate suite, cross_stream_consistency checks.
- Risk: Alert noise reduces trust.
  - Mitigation: Parity/coverage plus noise scoring in digest; require evidence in VALIDATED.
- Risk: Immutability friction.
  - Mitigation: New snapshot_rev per change; lightweight sealing; strong tooling.
- Risk: Governance overhead.
  - Mitigation: Declarative tags[]; automated Critical=0 check; codeowners.

### 10) Timeline & Next Steps
- Week 1: Define schemas for all artifacts; scaffold repo; CI for schema_lint.
- Week 2: Implement cross_stream_consistency and parity/coverage calculators.
- Week 3: Implement manifest sealing, rulebook hashing, and deployment evidence capture.
- Week 4: Generate first cycle `digest.md`, run end-to-end dry run, and iterate.
