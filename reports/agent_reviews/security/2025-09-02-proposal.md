## Security & Compliance Framework Module — Design Proposal

- Date: 2025-09-02
- Version: v0.1 (proposal)
- Owners: Security Engineering, Compliance, Platform
- Scope: Cross-repo, artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance (S&C) framework

## 1) Executive Summary

This proposal defines an artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance framework that standardizes how security findings, policies, exceptions, and handoffs are authored, validated, sealed, and measured across product streams. The design centers on machine-readable artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON) and a deterministic event lifecycle with quality gates to ensure consistency and enforce governance.

Key elements:
- Artifact-first interop: All outcomes are materialized as versioned text artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON).
- Event lifecycle: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE.
- Quality gates: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage.
- Immutable handoff manifest: cryptographic checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay: tags[] (PII, auth, license, etc.), Critical=0 rule, exception registry.
- Metrics spine: KPIs with a digest file per cycle for leadership and audit.

Outcomes: predictable handoffs, auditable artifacts, consistent governance, measurable performance, and continuous improvement.

## 2) Deliverables

Authoritative artifacts for each cycle (stored under repo-controlled directories, versioned in VCS):

- sec_findings.yaml: Canonical record of findings for the cycle.
- policy_map.md: Human-readable mapping from policies/controls to rules, tags, and owners.
- exceptions.md: Exception registry with approvals, scope, and expiry.
- handoff_manifest.yaml: Immutable manifest sealing the cycle handoff.
- digest.md: Metrics digest summarizing KPIs and gate outcomes.

Suggested default locations:
- Security reviews (proposal): `reports/agent_reviews/security/<date>-proposal.md`
- Findings: `frameworks/security/artifacts/<cycle>/sec_findings.yaml`
- Policy map: `frameworks/security/policy/policy_map.md`
- Exceptions: `frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.md`
- Handoff manifest: `frameworks/security/manifests/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- Digest: `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`

Example schema (sec_findings.yaml):
```yaml
schema_version: 1.0
run_id: 2025-09-02.01
snapshot_rev: "git:abcdef1234"              # Git snapshot or content-addressed ref
rulebook_hash: "sha256:..."                 # Hash of rulebook used during evaluation
stream: "payments-service"
cycle: "2025-09"
owners:
  - team: "payments-sec"
  - team: "app-platform"
tags: [PII, auth]
findings:
  - id: F-0001
    title: "PII in logs"
    severity: Critical
    category: data_exposure
    tags: [PII, logging]
    status: Open
    evidence_uri: s3://bucket/logs/sample
    first_seen: 2025-08-28
    last_seen: 2025-09-02
    affected_assets: ["payments-api", "worker-ingest"]
    controls: [LOG-RED-001, DLP-002]
    references: [CWE-312]
  - id: F-0002
    title: "Missing license header"
    severity: Low
    category: license
    tags: [license]
    status: Resolved
```

Example content (policy_map.md):
```md
# Policy → Rules → Tags → Owners

- LOG-RED-001
  - Purpose: Redact PII in logs
  - Rules: [rule:regex_pii_redaction, rule:log_sink_blocklist]
  - Tags: [PII, logging]
  - Owners: security-observability@company

- DLP-002
  - Purpose: Prevent sensitive exfiltration
  - Rules: [rule:egress_dlp_scan]
  - Tags: [PII, egress]
  - Owners: data-security@company
```

Example content (exceptions.md):
```md
# Exceptions Registry

- EX-001
  - Scope: payments-service/log-sanitizer
  - Related Findings: [F-0001]
  - Justification: Redaction rollout in progress
  - Risk: Medium
  - Temporary Compensating Controls: log sampling + alerting
  - Approved By: CISO (sig: sha256:...)
  - Requested: 2025-09-02, Expires: 2025-10-15
```

Example schema (handoff_manifest.yaml):
```yaml
manifest_version: 1
cycle: "2025-09"
snapshot_rev: "git:abcdef1234"
rulebook_hash: "sha256:..."
artifacts:
  - name: sec_findings
    path: frameworks/security/artifacts/2025-09/sec_findings.yaml
    sha256: "..."
  - name: policy_map
    path: frameworks/security/policy/policy_map.md
    sha256: "..."
  - name: exceptions
    path: frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.md
    sha256: "..."
quality_gates:
  schema_lint: pass
  cross_stream_consistency: pass
  parity_coverage: pass
signing:
  signed_by: release-bot@company
  signature: "BASE64_SIGNATURE"
  signed_at: "2025-09-02T12:34:56Z"
```

## 3) Events & Gates

Event lifecycle and required gates:

- PLANNED
  - Inputs: backlog, last cycle digest, policy deltas
  - Outputs: scoped plan, owners, target KPIs
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(plan artifacts)

- READY_FOR_HANDOFF
  - Inputs: draft artifacts, exception requests
  - Outputs: candidate `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(all), cross_stream_consistency

- PACKAGED
  - Inputs: frozen artifacts, reproducible build inputs
  - Outputs: pre-manifest artifact set
  - Exit gates: parity/coverage (across streams/services), schema_lint(all)

- EXECUTED
  - Inputs: packaged artifacts, automation runs
  - Outputs: evaluated findings, remediations, generated checksums
  - Exit gates: cross_stream_consistency (post-eval), schema_lint(findings)

- VALIDATED
  - Inputs: executed results, sign-offs
  - Outputs: immutable `handoff_manifest.yaml` (sealed)
  - Exit gates: Critical=0 (no Critical findings without time-bound exception), parity/coverage

- IMPROVE
  - Inputs: digest.md, retrospectives
  - Outputs: backlog updates, policy refinements
  - Exit gates: none; feeds next PLANNED

Gate definitions:
- schema_lint: Validate against JSON Schema/YAML meta-schema for all artifacts.
- cross_stream_consistency: Enforce shared constraints (e.g., severity scale, tag taxonomy, policy references) across streams.
- parity/coverage: Ensure required streams/services have artifacts; enforce coverage targets per policy.

## 4) Workflow

- Authoring
  - Security engineers author/update artifacts under `frameworks/security/...` in feature branches.
  - Use templates and schemas stored in-repo (see Acceptance Criteria).

- Automation
  - CI runs schema_lint on every change.
  - Nightly job checks cross_stream_consistency across all active streams.
  - Release pipeline enforces parity/coverage before PACKAGED.

- Reviews & Approvals
  - PRs require code owners from Security and the relevant service team.
  - Exceptions require approver signatures embedded in `exceptions.md` and captured in manifest.

- Versioning & Traceability
  - snapshot_rev pin on VALIDATED references commit SHA for all artifacts.
  - rulebook_hash pins the evaluation ruleset (content-addressed digest of rules).
  - Checksums ensure artifact immutability at handoff.

- Storage & Retention
  - Artifacts are committed to VCS; signed manifests are retained for ≥ 24 months.
  - Optional offsite store (e.g., object storage) mirrors sealed manifests and checksums.

## 5) Handoff & Sealing

- Assemble artifacts: `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`.
- Compute cryptographic checksums (sha256) over canonicalized content.
- Create `handoff_manifest.yaml` with: manifest_version, cycle, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, artifacts[], quality_gates, signing.
- Seal the handoff:
  - Write canonical file
  - Sign the manifest using organization key (Sigstore or X.509-based)
  - Store signature and signer identity in manifest
  - Treat the manifest as immutable; future changes require a superseding manifest

- Immutability guarantees:
  - Manifest path includes the cycle identifier
  - Checksums and snapshot_rev prevent content drift
  - CI prevents mutation to sealed manifests (write-protected path)

## 6) Governance Integration

- tags[] taxonomy
  - Standardized tags: PII, auth, license, infra, crypto, logging, egress, privacy, etc.
  - Each finding and policy maps to tags for reporting and routing.

- Critical=0 rule
  - VALIDATED requires zero Critical findings unless there is a time-bound, approved exception in `exceptions.md`.
  - If any Critical remains without exception, the handoff fails.

- Exception registry
  - All exceptions are recorded in `exceptions.md` with scope, justification, risk, controls, approver, and expiry.
  - CI verifies no expired exceptions cover open Critical findings.

- Policy governance
  - `policy_map.md` binds controls to rules and owners; changes require policy code owner review.

- Auditability
  - All governance decisions are captured as artifacts and sealed in `handoff_manifest.yaml`.

## 7) Metrics & Digest

KPIs (per cycle):
- Mean time to VALIDATED
- Gate pass rate by stage (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage)
- Open Critical at PACKAGED vs VALIDATED
- Exception count by severity and status (new/active/expired)
- Coverage parity across streams (% streams meeting required artifacts)
- Reopen rate (findings reopened after closure)

Digest file (`frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`) structure:
```md
## Cycle Digest — 2025-09-02

- Cycle: 2025-09
- Snapshot Rev: git:abcdef1234
- Rulebook Hash: sha256:...

### KPI Summary
- Time to VALIDATED: 6d
- Gate pass rate: schema_lint 100%, consistency 95%, parity/coverage 92%
- Critical at PACKAGED: 3 → at VALIDATED: 0
- Exceptions: 2 new, 1 active, 0 expired
- Coverage: 92% of required streams

### Gate Outcomes
- schema_lint: pass (all artifacts)
- cross_stream_consistency: 2 inconsistencies resolved
- parity/coverage: 3 streams below target; action items opened

### Exceptions Summary
- EX-001 (payments): approved, expires 2025-10-15

### Top Risks & Actions
- Log redaction rollout; action: enforce LOG-RED-001 by 2025-09-20
```

## 8) Acceptance Criteria

- Artifacts & Schemas
  - Templates for `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`, and `digest.md` exist and pass schema_lint.
  - CI job validates schema_lint on PRs touching security artifacts.

- Event Lifecycle & Gates
  - Pipeline implements lifecycle states with gate checks at transitions.
  - Failure of Critical=0 rule blocks VALIDATED and sealing.

- Immutability & Traceability
  - `handoff_manifest.yaml` includes snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and sha256 for all artifacts.
  - Sealed manifests are signed and protected against modification.

- Governance & Exceptions
  - tags[] taxonomy documented and enforced via lint.
  - Exceptions are validated for expiry and approver requirements.

- Metrics & Digest
  - Digest generation job writes `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md` each cycle.
  - KPIs computed and rendered; prior-cycle comparison supported.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Cross-stream drift
  - Mitigation: nightly cross_stream_consistency checks; shared schema registry.

- Exception abuse
  - Mitigation: approval ladder, expiry, compensating controls required; surfaced in digest.

- Hash/signing errors
  - Mitigation: canonicalization, deterministic hashing, Sigstore-backed verification in CI.

- Coverage gaps
  - Mitigation: parity/coverage gate hard-fail, visible KPI in digest.

- False positives / developer friction
  - Mitigation: rule tuning with rulebook_hash versioning; quick exception workflow with expiry.

- Timeline risk
  - Mitigation: phase deliverables; focus on artifacts and gates first.

## 10) Timeline & Next Steps

Phase 1 (Week 1–2):
- Define schemas and templates; implement schema_lint job.
- Establish tags[] taxonomy and Critical=0 gate.

Phase 2 (Week 3–4):
- Implement cross_stream_consistency and parity/coverage checks.
- Create manifest sealer with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and signing.

Phase 3 (Week 5–6):
- Wire pipeline stages to lifecycle; enforce gates.
- Generate first `digest.md`; run retrospective to populate IMPROVE.

Immediate next steps:
- Approve this design
- Create initial templates and schemas in `frameworks/security/`
- Stand up CI jobs for schema_lint and consistency checks
- Pilot on one stream (payments-service) before organization-wide rollout
