# Observability & Monitoring Framework Design

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: PROPOSAL  
**Author**: System Architecture Team  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Observability & Monitoring framework built on artifact-first principles with immutable handoffs and rigorous quality gates. The framework manages the complete lifecycle of observability artifacts (logs, metrics, alerts) from planning through validation, ensuring traceability, consistency, and governance compliance.

### Key Features:
- **Artifact-First Architecture**: All configurations and rules expressed as YAML/MD/JSON artifacts
- **Immutable Handoffs**: Cryptographically sealed manifests ensure artifact integrity
- **Event-Driven Lifecycle**: Six-stage pipeline from PLANNED to IMPROVE
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation at each lifecycle transition
- **Governance Integration**: Tag-based policies with Critical=0 enforcement
- **Metrics Spine**: Centralized KPI tracking with cycle-based digests

### Business Value:
- **Reduced MTTR**: 40% faster incident resolution through standardized observability
- **Compliance**: 100% audit trail for all monitoring changes
- **Quality**: Zero critical alerts in production through rigorous gates
- **Efficiency**: 60% reduction in manual configuration errors

## 5. Handoff & Sealing

### 5.1 Handoff Process

1. **Pre-Handoff Validation**
   - Run all quality gates
   - Generate artifact checksums
   - Capture git revision

2. **Manifest Generation**
   - Create handoff_manifest.yaml
   - Include all artifact references
   - Add validation results

3. **Cryptographic Sealing**
   - Generate combined hash of all artifacts
   - Sign with deployment key
   - Store seal in manifest

### 5.2 Immutability Guarantees

- **Checksum Verification**: SHA256 for each artifact
- **Snapshot Reference**: Git commit hash
- **Rulebook Hash**: Combined hash of all validation rules
- **Seal**: SHA512 of entire manifest

### 5.3 Handoff Verification

```bash
# Verify handoff integrity
observability-cli verify-handoff \
  --manifest handoff_manifest.yaml \
  --key deployment.pub
```

---

## 6. Governance Integration

### 6.1 Tag-Based Policies

#### **Tag Structure**
```yaml
tags:
  - environment: production
  - tier: 1
  - compliance: sox
  - data-classification: public
  - owner: platform-team
```

#### **Policy Examples**
- `Critical=0`: No critical alerts allowed in production
- `tier=1`: Requires 99.9% availability monitoring
- `compliance=sox`: Mandatory audit logging

### 6.2 Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - Tag validation in quality gates
   - Policy compliance checks
   - Owner approval for critical changes

2. **Runtime**
   - Continuous policy evaluation
   - Automatic remediation
   - Compliance reporting

### 6.3 Governance Dashboard

```yaml
governance_metrics:
  - policy_compliance: 98%
  - critical_violations: 0
  - pending_approvals: 3
  - audit_coverage: 100%
```
