# QA & Test Framework Module Design

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive QA & Test framework module designed for artifact-first interoperability, where all interactions occur through structured files (YAML/MD/JSON). The framework implements an event-driven lifecycle from PLANNED to IMPROVE, with immutable handoffs and governance overlays ensuring quality, traceability, and compliance.

Key innovations:
- **Artifact-First Architecture**: All communication through versioned, checksummed files
- **Event Lifecycle Management**: Six distinct states with automated transitions
- **Quality Gates**: Schema validation, cross-stream consistency, and coverage parity
- **Immutable Handoffs**: Cryptographic sealing of test bundles with manifests
- **Governance Integration**: Tag-based compliance tracking with exception management
- **Metrics Spine**: Standardized KPI emission across all framework components

## 3. Events & Gates

### 3.1 Event Lifecycle States

1. **PLANNED**: Test strategy defined, resources allocated
2. **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**: All artifacts prepared, pre-flight checks passed
3. **PACKAGED**: Bundle sealed with checksums and manifest
4. **EXECUTED**: Tests run, results collected
5. **VALIDATED**: Results verified, quality gates assessed
6. **IMPROVE**: Insights extracted, optimizations identified

### 3.2 Quality Gates

**schema_lint**
- Validates all YAML/JSON against defined schemas
- Checks required fields and data types
- Ensures governance tags present

**cross_stream_consistency**
- Verifies test coverage across all components
- Checks for orphaned test cases
- Validates traceability completeness

**parity/coverage**
- Compares actual vs target coverage
- Identifies gaps in test matrix
- Ensures balanced testing across dimensions

### 5.3 Verification
Recipients can verify bundle integrity by:
1. Recalculating checksums
2. Validating manifest signature
3. Checking snapshot_rev consistency
4. Confirming rulebook_hash

## 6. Governance Integration

### 6.1 Tag Taxonomy
```
governance.tags[]:
  - compliance.{sox|pci|gdpr|hipaa}
  - security.{critical|high|medium|low}
  - release.{version}
  - environment.{prod|staging|dev}
```

### 6.2 Critical Tag Management
- Critical=0 requirement before promotion
- Automated blocking of non-compliant artifacts
- Exception workflow for temporary overrides

### 6.3 Exception Structure
```yaml
exceptions:
  - rule_id: "crit-001"
    approver: "john.doe@company.com"
    expiry: "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
    rationale: "Known issue, fix in progress as JIRA-1234"
```
