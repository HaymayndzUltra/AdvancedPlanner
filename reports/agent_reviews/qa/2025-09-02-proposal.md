## 1) Executive Summary

This design establishes a complete, artifact-first QA & Test framework module where all interactions occur via files (YAML/MD/JSON). The framework defines a single event lifecycle—PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE—enforced by quality gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage). Every handoff is immutable and sealed by a manifest that records checksums, snapshot_rev, and rulebook_hash. A governance overlay requires governance.tags[] on all artifacts, enforces Critical=0 before promotion, and manages exceptions with {rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale}. A metrics spine outputs KPIs per cycle and emits a digest.md summarizing gate outcomes, KPIs, and exceptions.

Outcomes: reproducible handoffs, auditable evidence, measurable quality, and a plug-compatible file-based interface that integrates cleanly into CI/CD and human review flows.

## 2) Deliverables (test_matrix.yaml, traceability_map.md, evidence_index.md, handoff_manifest.yaml, digest.md)

- **test_matrix.yaml**: Authoritative catalog of test intents and execution plans.
  - **Purpose**: Central source of truth for what to test, why, and how.

    - Improvement actions snapshot

## 3) Events & Gates

Lifecycle states are explicit and file-driven. Promotion between states requires passing gates and producing required artifacts.

- **PLANNED**
  - Entry: New cycle declared; baseline requirements available.
  - Produce/Update: test_matrix.yaml (draft), governance.tags[] applied.
  - Exit: Requirements mapped to tests >= 80%; owners set; schema_lint runs in draft mode.

- **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**
  - Entry: test_matrix.yaml schema-valid; traceability_map.md created.
  - Gates to pass: schema_lint=PASS.
  - Exit: test_matrix.yaml frozen for packaging scope.

- **PACKAGED**
  - Entry: Handoff bundle prepared with handoff_manifest.yaml (checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash).
  - Gates to pass: cross_stream_consistency=PASS; parity/coverage=WARN or PASS within policy.
  - Exit: Bundle sealed (seals[] present) and published to storage.

- **EXECUTED**
  - Entry: Bundle consumed by runners; evidence generated.
  - Produce/Update: evidence_index.md with sha256 for each artifact; update tests[].evidence_refs.
  - Exit: Evidence sufficiency meets coverage targets.

- **VALIDATED**
  - Entry: Gates recomputed with produced evidence.
  - Gates to pass: schema_lint=PASS; cross_stream_consistency=PASS; parity/coverage=PASS; Critical=0.
  - Produce: digest.md.

- **IMPROVE**
  - Entry: Post-mortem on KPI deltas and exceptions.
  - Produce: learnings appended to digest.md; backlog of improvements.

- **Quality gates**
  - schema_lint: All YAML/JSON artifacts conform to schemas; no unknown required fields; no forbidden tag values.
  - cross_stream_consistency: Contracts across data_streams/services are aligned (versions, naming, required fields); zero conflicting assertions.
  - parity/coverage: Minimum coverage thresholds met and parity across parity_group within delta (e.g., ±5%).
  - Gate statuses: PASS | WARN | FAIL; promotion requires PASS unless policy grants time-bound exception.

## 4) Workflow

- **Authoring (PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF)**
  - Draft tests in test_matrix.yaml; tag with governance.tags[].
  - Generate traceability_map.md from the matrix; remediate gaps.
  - Run schema_lint and fix findings.

- **Sealing (READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED)**
  - Freeze scope; compute sha256 for all artifacts; record snapshot_rev and rulebook_hash.
  - Generate handoff_manifest.yaml with artifacts[], gates{} outcomes, exceptions (if any), seals[].
  - Publish bundle to artifact storage as the sole handoff mechanism.

- **Execution (PACKAGED → EXECUTED)**
  - Runners read only from the bundle; produce evidence artifacts and evidence_index.md.
  - Update evidence_refs in test_matrix.yaml (append-only in execution-specific copy).

- **Validation (EXECUTED → VALIDATED)**
  - Re-run gates using produced evidence; regenerate cross_stream_consistency and coverage.
  - Emit digest.md summarizing KPIs, gates, exceptions, and actions.

- **Continuous improvement (IMPROVE)**
  - Analyze KPI shortfalls; file improvement actions with owners and due dates.

## 5) Handoff & Sealing

- **Immutability rules**
  - Handoffs are represented by a directory or archive plus handoff_manifest.yaml.
  - Artifact contents are addressed by sha256; any change yields a new manifest and manifest_id.
  - snapshot_rev pins the upstream code/data baseline; rulebook_hash pins governance policy.

- **Sealing process**
  - Inventory artifacts and compute checksums and byte sizes.
  - Evaluate gates on the inventory; record outcomes in manifest.gates.
  - Capture exceptions, each with rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, scope.
  - Add seals[] entries from required signers (e.g., QA lead, product owner).
  - Publish manifest and artifacts to write-once storage; treat URIs as canonical.

- **Reproducibility**
  - Manifest imprint includes tool and environment versions to enable deterministic rebuilds.
  - Re-hash check must reproduce artifact sha256 values to score 1.0 on reproducibility KPI.

## 6) Governance Integration

- **Tags policy**
  - All artifacts carry governance.tags[] (e.g., criticality, regulatory_regime, data_classification, service_tier).
  - Critical=0 is required for promotion to VALIDATED; violations must be resolved or exceptioned.

- **Exceptions**
  - Structure: {rule_id, approver, expiry, rationale, scope}.
  - Scope defines the artifact(s) or gate(s) covered; multiple scopes require separate entries.
  - Expiry must be within the policy-defined window; expired exceptions fail promotion.
  - All exceptions are logged in manifest.exceptions[] and mirrored in digest.md.

- **Governance hooks**
  - schema_lint denies unknown or disallowed tag values.
  - Gate evaluation enforces Critical=0 and validates exception coverage.

## 7) Metrics & Digest

- **Metrics spine principles**
  - Each KPI has name, formula (text), source (artifact paths) and target policy.
  - Values are computed at VALIDATED using only artifacts in the sealed bundle.

- **Core KPIs**
  - schema_lint_pass_rate = passed_artifacts / total_artifacts (source: linter report, manifest.artifacts)
  - cross_stream_conflicts = count of consistency violations (source: consistency report)
  - coverage_min = min(coverage across parity_group) (source: test_matrix.yaml + evidence)
  - coverage_parity_delta = max(coverage) - min(coverage) within parity_group (source: same)
  - requirement_traceability = covered_requirements / total_requirements (source: traceability_map.md)
  - defect_escape_rate = post_release_defects / total_defects over last N cycles (source: defect log)
  - median_cycle_time_days = median(VALIDATED_at - PLANNED_at) (source: event timestamps)
  - exception_count_active = count(expiry ≥ now) (source: manifest.exceptions)
  - evidence_freshness_days = avg(now - generated_at) (source: evidence_index.md)
  - reproducibility_score = fraction of artifacts whose sha256 re-hash matches (source: re-hash check)

- **digest.md content contract**
  - Header with cycle_id, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, window, owners.
  - KPI table with value vs target and status (Green/Amber/Red).
  - Gate outcomes and links to evidence.
  - Exceptions with expiries and rationales.
  - Improvement actions with owners and due dates.

## 8) Acceptance Criteria

- All five deliverables are defined with unambiguous fields and lifecycles.
- Event lifecycle is represented by file transitions and required gate outcomes.
- Immutable handoff demonstrated by manifest with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay present on all artifacts with governance.tags[]; Critical=0 enforced before promotion.
- Exceptions follow the required structure and are time-bound; expired exceptions block promotion.
- Metrics spine computes KPIs from artifacts only; digest.md produced each cycle.
- Documentation clear enough for a new team to execute without tribal knowledge.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- **Operational overhead**: Too many artifacts can slow teams.
  - Mitigation: Automate generation (traceability_map.md, evidence_index.md, digest.md), templates, and pre-commit checks.
- **False positives in gates**: Noisy linting or inconsistent sources.
  - Mitigation: Strict schemas, curated rulebook, and calibrate gates with WARN periods.
- **Cross-stream alignment complexity**: Many services/data streams diverge.
  - Mitigation: Define parity_group and version contracts; prioritize P0 streams.
- **Exception misuse**: Overuse to bypass policy.
  - Mitigation: Require approver and expiry; report exception_count_active in digest; audit.
- **Reproducibility drift**: Environment differences lead to mismatches.
  - Mitigation: Record imprint; require reproducibility_score ≥ 0.95 for promotion.
- **Artifact sprawl**: Multiple copies of similar files.
  - Mitigation: Single source of truth per cycle; immutable bundles; de-dup via sha256.

## 10) Timeline & Next Steps

- **Week 1**: Finalize schemas and templates for all deliverables; define rulebook and lint rules; bootstrap governance.tags[] vocabulary.
- **Week 2**: Implement gate evaluators and packaging process; produce a sample sealed bundle; dry-run digest.
- **Week 3**: Pilot on one product/data stream; calibrate gates, targets, and parity groups; document playbooks.
- **Week 4**: Rollout to all streams; enable enforcement (Critical=0) and promotion policies; baseline KPIs.

- **Immediate next steps**
  - Create seed templates for test_matrix.yaml, traceability_map.md, evidence_index.md, handoff_manifest.yaml, digest.md.
  - Stand up linting and consistency checks in CI using file-only inputs/outputs.
  - Identify first pilot cycle and owners; schedule handoff and validation dates.
