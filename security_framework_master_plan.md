## Security & Compliance Framework Module — Design Proposal

- Date: 2025-09-02
- Version: v0.1 (proposal)
- Owners: Security Engineering, Compliance, Platform
- Scope: Cross-repo, artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance (S&C) framework

## 1) Executive Summary

This proposal defines an artifact-first, event-driven Security & Compliance framework that standardizes how security findings, policies, exceptions, and handoffs are authored, validated, sealed, and measured across product streams. The design centers on machine-readable artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON) and a deterministic event lifecycle with quality gates to ensure consistency and enforce governance.

Key elements:
- Artifact-first interop: All outcomes are materialized as versioned text artifacts (YAML/MD/JSON).
- Event lifecycle: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE.
- Quality gates: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage.
- Immutable handoff manifest: cryptographic checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash.
- Governance overlay: tags[] (PII, auth, license, etc.), Critical=0 rule, exception registry.
- Metrics spine: KPIs with a digest file per cycle for leadership and audit.

Outcomes: predictable handoffs, auditable artifacts, consistent governance, measurable performance, and continuous improvement.

## 2) Deliverables

Authoritative artifacts for each cycle (stored under repo-controlled directories, versioned in VCS):

- sec_findings.yaml: Canonical record of findings for the cycle.
- policy_map.md: Human-readable mapping from policies/controls to rules, tags, and owners.
- exceptions.md: Exception registry with approvals, scope, and expiry.
- handoff_manifest.yaml: Immutable manifest sealing the cycle handoff.
- digest.md: Metrics digest summarizing KPIs and gate outcomes.

Suggested default locations:
- Security reviews (proposal): `reports/agent_reviews/security/<date>-proposal.md`
- Findings: `frameworks/security/artifacts/<cycle>/sec_findings.yaml`
- Policy map: `frameworks/security/policy/policy_map.md`
- Exceptions: `frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.md`
- Handoff manifest: `frameworks/security/manifests/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- Digest: `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`

Example schema (sec_findings.yaml):
```yaml
schema_version: 1.0
run_id: 2025-09-02.01
snapshot_rev: "git:abcdef1234"              # Git snapshot or content-addressed ref
rulebook_hash: "sha256:..."                 # Hash of rulebook used during evaluation
stream: "payments-service"
cycle: "2025-09"
owners:
  - team: "payments-sec"
  - team: "app-platform"
tags: [PII, auth]
findings:
  - id: F-0001
    title: "PII in logs"
    severity: Critical
    category: data_exposure
    tags: [PII, logging]
    status: Open
    evidence_uri: s3://bucket/logs/sample
    first_seen: 2025-08-28
    last_seen: 2025-09-02
    affected_assets: ["payments-api", "worker-ingest"]
    controls: [LOG-RED-001, DLP-002]
    references: [CWE-312]
  - id: F-0002
    title: "Missing license header"
    severity: Low
    category: license
    tags: [license]
    status: Resolved
```

Example content (policy_map.md):
```md
# Policy → Rules → Tags → Owners

- LOG-RED-001
  - Purpose: Redact PII in logs
  - Rules: [rule:regex_pii_redaction, rule:log_sink_blocklist]
  - Tags: [PII, logging]
  - Owners: security-observability@company

- DLP-002
  - Purpose: Prevent sensitive exfiltration
  - Rules: [rule:egress_dlp_scan]
  - Tags: [PII, egress]
  - Owners: data-security@company
```

Example content (exceptions.md):
```md
# Exceptions Registry

- EX-001
  - Scope: payments-service/log-sanitizer
  - Related Findings: [F-0001]
  - Justification: Redaction rollout in progress
  - Risk: Medium
  - Temporary Compensating Controls: log sampling + alerting
  - Approved By: CISO (sig: sha256:...)
  - Requested: 2025-09-02, Expires: 2025-10-15
```

Example schema (handoff_manifest.yaml):
```yaml
manifest_version: 1
cycle: "2025-09"
snapshot_rev: "git:abcdef1234"
rulebook_hash: "sha256:..."
artifacts:
  - name: sec_findings
    path: frameworks/security/artifacts/2025-09/sec_findings.yaml
    sha256: "..."
  - name: policy_map
    path: frameworks/security/policy/policy_map.md
    sha256: "..."
  - name: exceptions
    path: frameworks/security/policy/exceptions.md
    sha256: "..."
quality_gates:
  schema_lint: pass
  cross_stream_consistency: pass
  parity_coverage: pass
signing:
  signed_by: release-bot@company
  signature: "BASE64_SIGNATURE"
  signed_at: "2025-09-02T12:34:56Z"
```

## 3) Events & Gates

Event lifecycle and required gates:

- PLANNED
  - Inputs: backlog, last cycle digest, policy deltas
  - Outputs: scoped plan, owners, target KPIs
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(plan artifacts)

- READY_FOR_HANDOFF
  - Inputs: draft artifacts, exception requests
  - Outputs: candidate `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`
  - Exit gates: schema_lint(all), cross_stream_consistency

- PACKAGED
  - Inputs: frozen artifacts, reproducible build inputs
  - Outputs: pre-manifest artifact set
  - Exit gates: parity/coverage (across streams/services), schema_lint(all)

- EXECUTED
  - Inputs: packaged artifacts, automation runs
  - Outputs: evaluated findings, remediations, generated checksums
  - Exit gates: cross_stream_consistency (post-eval), schema_lint(findings)

- VALIDATED
  - Inputs: executed results, sign-offs
  - Outputs: immutable `handoff_manifest.yaml` (sealed)
  - Exit gates: Critical=0 (no Critical findings without time-bound exception), parity/coverage

- IMPROVE
  - Inputs: digest.md, retrospectives
  - Outputs: backlog updates, policy refinements
  - Exit gates: none; feeds next PLANNED

Gate definitions:
- schema_lint: Validate against JSON Schema/YAML meta-schema for all artifacts.
- cross_stream_consistency: Enforce shared constraints (e.g., severity scale, tag taxonomy, policy references) across streams.
- parity/coverage: Ensure required streams/services have artifacts; enforce coverage targets per policy.

## 4) Workflow

- Authoring
  - Security engineers author/update artifacts under `frameworks/security/...` in feature branches.
  - Use templates and schemas stored in-repo (see Acceptance Criteria).

- Automation
  - CI runs schema_lint on every change.
  - Nightly job checks cross_stream_consistency across all active streams.
  - Release pipeline enforces parity/coverage before PACKAGED.

- Reviews & Approvals
  - PRs require code owners from Security and the relevant service team.
  - Exceptions require approver signatures embedded in `exceptions.md` and captured in manifest.

- Versioning & Traceability
  - snapshot_rev pin on VALIDATED references commit SHA for all artifacts.
  - rulebook_hash pins the evaluation ruleset (content-addressed digest of rules).
  - Checksums ensure artifact immutability at handoff.

- Storage & Retention
  - Artifacts are committed to VCS; signed manifests are retained for ≥ 24 months.
  - Optional offsite store (e.g., object storage) mirrors sealed manifests and checksums.

## 5) Handoff & Sealing

- Assemble artifacts: `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`.
- Compute cryptographic checksums (sha256) over canonicalized content.
- Create `handoff_manifest.yaml` with: manifest_version, cycle, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, artifacts[], quality_gates, signing.
- Seal the handoff:
  - Write canonical file
  - Sign the manifest using organization key (Sigstore or X.509-based)
  - Store signature and signer identity in manifest
  - Treat the manifest as immutable; future changes require a superseding manifest

- Immutability guarantees:
  - Manifest path includes the cycle identifier
  - Checksums and snapshot_rev prevent content drift
  - CI prevents mutation to sealed manifests (write-protected path)

## 6) Governance Integration

- tags[] taxonomy
  - Standardized tags: PII, auth, license, infra, crypto, logging, egress, privacy, etc.
  - Each finding and policy maps to tags for reporting and routing.

- Critical=0 rule
  - VALIDATED requires zero Critical findings unless there is a time-bound, approved exception in `exceptions.md`.
  - If any Critical remains without exception, the handoff fails.

- Exception registry
  - All exceptions are recorded in `exceptions.md` with scope, justification, risk, controls, approver, and expiry.
  - CI verifies no expired exceptions cover open Critical findings.

- Policy governance
  - `policy_map.md` binds controls to rules and owners; changes require policy code owner review.

- Auditability
  - All governance decisions are captured as artifacts and sealed in `handoff_manifest.yaml`.

## 7) Metrics & Digest

KPIs (per cycle):
- Mean time to VALIDATED
- Gate pass rate by stage (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage)
- Open Critical at PACKAGED vs VALIDATED
- Exception count by severity and status (new/active/expired)
- Coverage parity across streams (% streams meeting required artifacts)
- Reopen rate (findings reopened after closure)

Digest file (`frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`) structure:
```md
## Cycle Digest — 2025-09-02

- Cycle: 2025-09
- Snapshot Rev: git:abcdef1234
- Rulebook Hash: sha256:...

### KPI Summary
- Time to VALIDATED: 6d
- Gate pass rate: schema_lint 100%, consistency 95%, parity/coverage 92%
- Critical at PACKAGED: 3 → at VALIDATED: 0
- Exceptions: 2 new, 1 active, 0 expired
- Coverage: 92% of required streams

### Gate Outcomes
- schema_lint: pass (all artifacts)
- cross_stream_consistency: 2 inconsistencies resolved
- parity/coverage: 3 streams below target; action items opened

### Exceptions Summary
- EX-001 (payments): approved, expires 2025-10-15

### Top Risks & Actions
- Log redaction rollout; action: enforce LOG-RED-001 by 2025-09-20
```

## 8) Acceptance Criteria

- Artifacts & Schemas
  - Templates for `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`, and `digest.md` exist and pass schema_lint.
  - CI job validates schema_lint on PRs touching security artifacts.

- Event Lifecycle & Gates
  - Pipeline implements lifecycle states with gate checks at transitions.
  - Failure of Critical=0 rule blocks VALIDATED and sealing.

- Immutability & Traceability
  - `handoff_manifest.yaml` includes snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and sha256 for all artifacts.
  - Sealed manifests are signed and protected against modification.

- Governance & Exceptions
  - tags[] taxonomy documented and enforced via lint.
  - Exceptions are validated for expiry and approver requirements.

- Metrics & Digest
  - Digest generation job writes `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md` each cycle.
  - KPIs computed and rendered; prior-cycle comparison supported.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- Cross-stream drift
  - Mitigation: nightly cross_stream_consistency checks; shared schema registry.

- Exception abuse
  - Mitigation: approval ladder, expiry, compensating controls required; surfaced in digest.

- Hash/signing errors
  - Mitigation: canonicalization, deterministic hashing, Sigstore-backed verification in CI.

- Coverage gaps
  - Mitigation: parity/coverage gate hard-fail, visible KPI in digest.

- False positives / developer friction
  - Mitigation: rule tuning with rulebook_hash versioning; quick exception workflow with expiry.

- Timeline risk
  - Mitigation: phase deliverables; focus on artifacts and gates first.

## 10) Timeline & Next Steps

Phase 1 (Week 1–2):
- Define schemas and templates; implement schema_lint job.
- Establish tags[] taxonomy and Critical=0 gate.

Phase 2 (Week 3–4):
- Implement cross_stream_consistency and parity/coverage checks.
- Create manifest sealer with checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, and signing.

Phase 3 (Week 5–6):
- Wire pipeline stages to lifecycle; enforce gates.
- Generate first `digest.md`; run retrospective to populate IMPROVE.

Immediate next steps:
- Approve this design
- Create initial templates and schemas in `frameworks/security/`
- Stand up CI jobs for schema_lint and consistency checks
- Pilot on one stream (payments-service) before organization-wide rollout

# Security & Compliance Framework Module Design

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Author:** Framework Design Team  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Security & Compliance framework module that operates through artifact-first interoperability and follows a rigorous event lifecycle from planning to continuous improvement. The framework enforces quality gates, immutable handoff manifests, and governance overlays while maintaining a metrics spine for continuous monitoring and improvement.

### Key Principles
- **Artifact-First Architecture**: All interactions via YAML/MD/JSON artifacts
- **Event-Driven Lifecycle**: PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE
- **Quality-Gate Enforcement**: Schema validation, cross-stream consistency, and coverage parity
- **Immutable Handoffs**: Cryptographic sealing with checksums and hashes
- **Governance-First**: Tag-based compliance with Critical=0 enforcement
- **Metrics-Driven**: KPI tracking with digest generation per cycle

---

## 2. Deliverables

### 1) Executive Summary

This proposal defines a complete, artifact‑first Security & Compliance framework module designed for interoperability across pipelines through YAML/MD/JSON files. It introduces a deterministic event lifecycle (PLANNED → READY_FOR_HANDOFF → PACKAGED → EXECUTED → VALIDATED → IMPROVE), mandatory quality gates (schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage), and an immutable handoff manifest that seals deliverables with checksums, a snapshot_rev, and a rulebook_hash. A governance overlay standardizes tags[] (PII, auth, license, etc.), enforces a Critical=0 rule at handoff, and maintains a time‑boxed exception registry. A metrics spine defines KPIs and produces a per‑cycle digest to drive continuous improvement.


### 2) Deliverables

Artifact‑first deliverables are plain‑text files committed to version control and exchanged across teams/systems:

- **sec_findings.yaml**: Normalized security findings and metadata for a cycle.
- **policy_map.md**: Human‑readable map of policies/rules to products/streams with tags.
- **exceptions.md**: Governance exceptions (approved, scoped, time‑boxed) with YAML front matter.
- **handoff_manifest.yaml**: Immutable, sealed manifest listing artifacts, checksums, and gate results.
- **digest.md**: Cycle digest with KPIs, gate outcomes, and action items.

Recommended locations and naming:

- `reports/security/<cycle>/sec_findings.yaml`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/policy_map.md`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/exceptions.md`
- `reports/security/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`


### 3) Events & Gates

Event lifecycle and required gates at each transition:

1. **PLANNED** → **READY_FOR_HANDOFF**
   - Gates: schema_lint (draft artifacts), cross_stream_consistency (tags/severity normalization), parity/coverage baseline defined
2. **READY_FOR_HANDOFF** → **PACKAGED**
   - Gates: schema_lint (all artifacts), cross_stream_consistency (streams aligned), parity/coverage threshold ≥ target
3. **PACKAGED** → **EXECUTED**
   - Gates: handoff_manifest.yaml constructed and sealed (checksums + snapshot_rev + rulebook_hash)
4. **EXECUTED** → **VALIDATED**
   - Gates: Critical=0 at handoff, exception registry referenced for any overrides, evidence attached
5. **VALIDATED** → **IMPROVE**
   - Gates: digest.md published with KPIs, remediation plan logged, improvement items triaged

Gate definitions:

- **schema_lint**: Validate artifacts against schemas; fail on unknown required fields, type mismatches, or missing IDs.
- **cross_stream_consistency**: Ensure severity normalization, tag vocabulary, and policy mappings are consistent across app/infra/data streams.
- **parity/coverage**: Verify rule/policy parity across languages/streams and minimum coverage for assets in scope.


### 4) Workflow

End‑to‑end workflow aligned to the lifecycle:

1. **Plan (PLANNED)**
   - Define scope, assets, and rulebook revision to use.
   - Initialize empty `sec_findings.yaml` draft; draft `policy_map.md` and `exceptions.md`.
   - Run schema_lint and cross_stream_consistency on drafts.

2. **Handoff Prep (READY_FOR_HANDOFF)**
   - Populate `sec_findings.yaml` with normalized findings.
   - Finalize `policy_map.md` mappings and `exceptions.md` entries.
   - Re‑run schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage; record results.

3. **Package (PACKAGED)**
   - Create `handoff_manifest.yaml` with checksums for all artifacts, snapshot_rev (e.g., VCS commit), rulebook_hash (hash of policy/rule set).
   - Seal manifest (set sealed=true) and optionally cryptographically sign.

4. **Execute (EXECUTED)**
   - Consume artifacts downstream (e.g., CI/CD, GRC, SIEM), execute validations, collect evidence.

5. **Validate (VALIDATED)**
   - Enforce Critical=0 rule; only exceptions explicitly listed in `exceptions.md` may waive non‑critical gates.
   - Attach evidence and adjudicate findings; update statuses.

6. **Improve (IMPROVE)**
   - Publish `digest.md` with KPIs and gate outcomes.
   - File remediation items; adjust policy_map or rulebook for gaps.


### 5) Handoff & Sealing

The handoff is immutably sealed using `handoff_manifest.yaml`:

- Contains: artifact file paths, sha256 checksums, `snapshot_rev`, `rulebook_hash`, gate outcomes, `critical_zero_pass`, exception summary, `sealed` flag.
- Immutable rule: Any content change requires a new cycle ID and a new sealed manifest.
- Optional: Signature fields (`signed_by`, `signature`, `key_id`) for additional integrity.

Example `handoff_manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
cycle_id: 2025-09-02
created_at: 2025-09-02T00:00:00Z
produced_by: security_framework@v1
snapshot_rev: "git:7f1c2e9"
rulebook_hash: "sha256:beef..."
artifacts:
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/sec_findings.yaml
    sha256: "..."
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/policy_map.md
    sha256: "..."
  - path: reports/security/2025-09-02/exceptions.md
    sha256: "..."
gates:
  schema_lint: pass
  cross_stream_consistency: pass
  parity_coverage:
    status: pass
    coverage_pct: 92
critical_zero_pass: true
exceptions:
  total: 2
  open: 2
  expiring_next_30d: 1
sealed: true

# Optional cryptographic sealing
signature:
  key_id: "kms:projects/.../keys/..."
  signed_by: security-bot@company.com
  signature: "base64..."
```


### 6) Governance Integration

- **tags[] vocabulary**: Standard tags applied to findings and policies: `PII`, `auth`, `license`, `crypto`, `secrets`, `network`, `appsec`, `infra`, `data`, `compliance`, `privacy`, `availability`, `integrity`, `confidentiality`.
- **Critical=0 rule**: At handoff, no Critical‑severity findings are permitted. Transition to VALIDATED fails if any Critical exists without a time‑boxed, approved exception (not recommended).
- **Exception registry**: All exceptions must be listed in `exceptions.md` with owner, scope, justification, expiry, ticket, and review cadence. Expired exceptions automatically invalidate handoff.

`exceptions.md` structure (YAML front matter + body):

```markdown
---
schema_version: 1
cycle_id: 2025-09-02
registry:
  - exception_id: EX-2025-001
    title: Temporary waiver for third‑party SCA medium alerts
    owner: team-appsec
    scope:
      service: payments-api
      tags: [license]
      applies_to_findings: [F-1234, F-5678]

    owner: team-platform
    scope:
      asset: edge-gateway
      tags: [auth]
    justification: Control redesign in progress.
    expires_on: 2025-10-01
    ticket: SEC-8199
    approved_by: deputy-ciso@company.com
    status: approved
---

Exceptions are time‑boxed and must be re‑approved upon expiry.
```


### 7) Metrics & Digest

KPIs form a metrics spine and feed `digest.md` each cycle:

- **Gate pass rate**: % cycles with all gates passing on first attempt
- **Critical findings count**: Must be zero at handoff
- **Exception debt**: Count and aging of open exceptions
- **Coverage parity**: Rule/policy coverage across streams (% parity)
- **MTTR for High findings**: Days to remediate high‑severity items
- **Rule drift**: Difference between `rulebook_hash` across cycles
- **Change failure rate**: % handoffs requiring re‑packaging
- **Time to validate**: Duration between EXECUTED and VALIDATED

`digest.md` structure:

```markdown
### Cycle Digest — 2025-09-02

- **Cycle ID**: 2025-09-02
- **Snapshot Rev**: git:7f1c2e9
- **Rulebook Hash**: sha256:beef...

#### Gate Results
- **schema_lint**: pass
- **cross_stream_consistency**: pass
- **parity/coverage**: 92% (target ≥ 90%) — pass
- **Critical=0**: pass

#### KPIs
- **Gate pass rate (rolling 4)**: 75% → 100%
- **Critical findings**: 0
- **Exception debt**: 2 open (1 expiring in 30 days)
- **Coverage parity**: App 94%, Infra 90%, Data 92%
- **MTTR (High)**: 9.2 days
- **Rule drift**: unchanged

#### Actions
- **Remediate**: SCA license issues in payments‑api (SEC-8123)
- **Improve**: Align Data stream auth rules with App stream
```


### 8) Acceptance Criteria

- **Lifecycle**: All six states implemented with auditable transitions.
- **Gates**: schema_lint, cross_stream_consistency, parity/coverage enforced; failures block transitions.
- **Manifest**: `handoff_manifest.yaml` includes checksums, snapshot_rev, rulebook_hash, gate results, sealed flag.
- **Governance**: tags[] vocabulary enforced; Critical=0 rule at handoff; `exceptions.md` validated and time‑boxed.
- **Artifacts**: `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, `handoff_manifest.yaml`, `digest.md` present and schema‑valid.
- **Metrics**: `digest.md` produced per cycle with KPIs and action items.


### 9) Risks & Mitigations

- **Over‑blocking releases**: Gates may block delivery.
  - Mitigate with risk‑scoped exceptions, clear SLOs, and staged rollout.
- **Tag inconsistency**: Divergent tag usage across teams.
  - Mitigate with a controlled vocabulary and linting.
- **Rulebook drift**: Unsynchronized rule updates.
  - Mitigate with rulebook_hash pinning and change review.
- **Exception creep**: Growing exception debt.
  - Mitigate with expiry enforcement and executive review.
- **Data sprawl**: Artifacts scattered across repos.
  - Mitigate with central index and manifest sealing.


### 10) Timeline & Next Steps

Phased delivery over four weeks:

- **Week 1**: Define schemas; implement schema_lint; establish tags[] vocabulary; enforce Critical=0 at handoff.
- **Week 2**: Build cross_stream_consistency checks; draft policy_map.md; pilot in one app stream.
- **Week 3**: Implement parity/coverage calculations; produce first `handoff_manifest.yaml` and sealed handoff.
- **Week 4**: Automate digest generation; publish `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`; start continuous improvement loop.

Immediate next steps:

- Create initial artifact templates for `sec_findings.yaml`, `policy_map.md`, `exceptions.md`, and `handoff_manifest.yaml`.
- Stand up linting and consistency checks in CI.
- Publish first `digest.md` using the metrics spine.
