### CHANGELOG

#### `v2.2.0` - Framework Agnosticism & Collaboration Overhaul

##### üöÄ REFACTORING

1.  **Overhauled the `AI Collaboration Guidelines` (Rule #2)**
    *   **Why:** To create a more robust, structured, and clear protocol for AI-user interaction, moving beyond simple agnosticism to a comprehensive collaboration model.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Introduced foundational `Core Principles of Interaction` (Think-First, Concise Communication).
        *   Formalized a `Task Planning and Execution Protocol` with distinct phases (Planning, Breakdown, Execution).
        *   Explicitly extended tool agnosticism to `Code Modification and Information Retrieval`.
        *   Centralized all `Standard Communication Formats` for clarity and consistency.

2.  **Made the Entire Framework Tool-Agnostic**
    *   **Why:** To ensure the AI Governor Framework can be used with any LLM and in any AI-assisted code editor (Cursor, Windmill, etc.). The framework should not depend on specific, hardcoded tool names.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Introduced a new **`Tool Usage Protocol`** in the `AI Collaboration Guidelines` (Rule #2). This protocol mandates a two-step process for the AI: first, discover available tools in its environment, and second, use the appropriate one.
        *   All `master-rules` and `dev-workflow` protocols have been refactored to remove explicit tool names (e.g., `codebase_search`, `edit_file`) and now refer to this agnostic protocol. The framework now instructs the AI to "use a file editing tool" rather than "use `edit_file`".
    *   **Benefit:** This change dramatically increases the portability and future-proofing of the framework, making it a truly universal standard for AI governance.

#### `v2.1.0` - UI Governance Ruleset

##### ‚ú® NEW FEATURES

1.  **Introduced UI Governance Rule Pack**
    *   **Why:** To provide a specialized, ready-to-use governance layer for modern UI development, covering foundational design systems, accessibility, performance, and brand consistency for premium features.
    *   **Impact:** Added three new `common-rules` to enforce best practices in UI engineering:
        *   `common-rule-ui-foundation-design-system.mdc`: Ensures adherence to the core design system.
        *   `common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc`: Focuses on accessibility and interaction performance.
        *   `common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc`: Manages brand identity and access to premium UI components.

#### `v2.0.0` - Architectural & Strategic Overhaul

This major update marks a strategic redesign of the project's identity and governance system to better align with its core mission: providing robust governance for AI-driven software development.

##### üè∑Ô∏è IDENTITY & STRATEGY

1.  **Project Renamed to `The Governor Framework`**
    *   **Why:** The original name was too generic. The new identity, `The Governor Framework - The Keystone for AI-Driven Code`, better reflects the project's core mission of moving beyond simple AI *assistance* to active *governance*. It directly addresses the growing developer need for control, consistency, and quality in an AI-driven landscape.
    *   **Impact:** All documentation has been updated to reflect this new, focused identity.

2.  **Community Hub Launched via GitHub Discussions**
    *   **Why:** To create a central place for users to collaborate, share rule sets (`project-rules`), and shape the future of the framework, transforming it from a repository into a community-driven standard.
    *   **Impact:** Discussions are now the primary channel for community interaction.

3.  **Switched to a Template Repository**
    *   **Why:** To dramatically simplify project adoption. Users can now create their own governed repository with a single click ("Use this template"), rather than cloning and cleaning the history.
    *   **Impact:** The bootstrap protocol (`0-bootstrap-your-project.md`) has been significantly simplified, making the framework truly "plug-and-play".

##### ‚ú® NEW FEATURES

1.  **Introduced `Code Modification Safety Protocol` (Rule #4)**
    *   **A new central pillar for modification safety.** This comprehensive rule systematizes impact analysis, dependency mapping, risk assessment (Low, Medium, High), and differentiated modification strategies.
    *   It mandates the `[IMPACT ANALYSIS]` announcement and formalizes communication protocols for escalation and rollbacks (`[EMERGENCY ROLLBACK]`).
    *   It centralizes and massively expands on the concept of regression prevention, which was previously a small section in the quality rule.

2.  **Introduced `Complex Feature Context Preservation` (Rule #6)**
    *   **A new semantic safety layer.** This specialized rule activates upon detecting complex code, using heuristics based on size, cyclomatic complexity, and advanced design patterns.
    *   It mandates the creation of "context snapshots," a defensive modification strategy ("add rather than replace"), and proactive communication protocols (`[COMPLEX FEATURE DETECTED]`, `[COMPLEXITY OVERWHELM]`) for interventions in critical code.
    *   Aims to preserve the implicit business logic and development history that cannot be captured by purely mechanical analysis.
    
##### üöÄ WORKFLOW
1.  **Simplified 3-Step Development Lifecycle**
    *   **Why:** The previous 4-step process was unnecessarily complex. Merging task generation into the PRD creation simplifies the workflow and reduces friction.
    *   **Impact:** The main `README.md` now presents a clearer, more direct 3-step process: **1. Create PRD & Tasks**, **2. Execute Tasks**, **3. Conduct Retrospective**.

2.  **Introduced "Focus Mode" as the Default**
    *   **Why:** To improve contextual stability and performance by executing all sub-tasks of a parent task in a single batch before requiring user validation.
    *   **Impact:** The `3-process-tasks.md` protocol has been updated to operate exclusively in this mode, streamlining implementation.

3.  **Formalized the "One Parent Task, One Chat" Rule in the Workflow**
    *   **Why:** To prevent context window saturation ("token cannibalization") and maintain high performance during implementation.
    *   **Impact:** The core development workflow (`3-process-tasks.md`) now mandates starting a new, clean chat session for each parent task.

4.  **Added Context Management Protocol to Collaboration Guidelines (Rule #2)**
    *   **Why:** To provide the AI with a formal protocol for proactively managing the conversation's context, supporting the "One Chat" rule.
    *   **Impact:** `2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines.md` now includes a new section defining when and how the AI should suggest a `[CONTEXT REFRESH SUGGESTION]`, including criteria like context drift or the completion of a complex task.

##### ‚ôªÔ∏è REFACTORING

1.  **`AI Collaboration Guidelines` (Rule #2)**
    *   **Strategic Refocus.** Responsibility for pre-modification code analysis has been delegated to the new Rule #4.
    *   **Added Meta-Governance Protocol.** The rule now focuses on collaboration and introduces a `[STRICT]` protocol for modifying master rules themselves (`[GOVERNANCE MODIFICATION PROPOSAL]`), reinforcing the framework's stability.

2.  **`Code Quality Checklist` (Rule #3)**
    *   **Specialization.** The `Security & Non-Regression Protocol` section was removed, with its responsibilities transferred and greatly expanded in the new Rule #4.
    *   The rule now focuses purely on intrinsic code quality (e.g., robustness, clarity, naming conventions), clarifying its purpose.

3.  **`Documentation and Context Guidelines` (Rule #5)**
    *   **Minor Easing.** The requirement (`[STRICT]`) to analyze existing documentation standards before coding has been relaxed to a recommendation (`[GUIDELINE]`) for greater flexibility.
    *   The core of the rule‚Äîpost-modification documentation synchronization‚Äîremains `[STRICT]` and robust.

##### üìö DOCUMENTATION

1.  **Clarified Development Workflow in `README.md`**
    *   **Why:** The previous instructions were mixed. The new structure clearly separates the "Why", "How" (the 5-step lifecycle), and "What" (practical execution steps).
    *   **Impact:** Provides a much clearer and more actionable guide for new users to get started with the framework.

2.  **Formalized the 3-Layer Rule Hierarchy in `rules/README.md`**
    *   **Why:** To explain the defense-in-depth architecture of the rule system.
    *   **Impact:** Introduces the concepts of Foundation (BIOS), Execution (Guardians), and Specialization (Experts), making the governance model easier to understand and extend.

##### üöÄ OVERALL IMPACT

The governance framework has gained significant **substance, force, and robustness**. The shift to specialized rules creates a more mature "defense-in-depth" system, capable of differentiating risk levels and applying security protocols tailored to each context.
