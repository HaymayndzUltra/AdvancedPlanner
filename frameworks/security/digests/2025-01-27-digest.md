# Security & Compliance Framework Digest

**Period:** 2025-01-27  
**Type:** Framework Design Baseline  
**Status:** INITIAL

## Executive Summary

This digest establishes the baseline metrics and KPIs for the Security & Compliance Framework Module. As this is the initial design phase, all metrics represent target states and expected operational parameters once the framework is fully implemented.

### Framework Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Achieve Critical=0 compliance with < 5 day MTTR
- **Coverage Target**: > 95% policy coverage across all systems
- **Automation Level**: 80% of security workflows automated
- **Quality Gates**: 100% artifact validation before handoff

## Metrics Framework Design

### 1. Data Collection Architecture

```yaml
metrics_pipeline:
  sources:
    - security_scanners:
        frequency: continuous
        data_points: [findings, scan_duration, coverage]
    - artifact_validators:
        frequency: per_commit
        data_points: [schema_validity, consistency_score]
    - handoff_system:
        frequency: per_handoff
        data_points: [checksum_validity, seal_integrity]
    - exception_registry:
        frequency: daily
        data_points: [active_count, expiry_status, compliance]
        
  aggregation:
    - level_1: raw_metrics (1-minute retention: 7 days)
    - level_2: hourly_rollup (retention: 30 days)
    - level_3: daily_summary (retention: 365 days)
    - level_4: monthly_digest (retention: 7 years)
```

### 2. KPI Calculation Formulas

#### Response Metrics
```python
# Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
mttd = sum(detection_time - vulnerability_introduction_time) / count(detected_vulnerabilities)

# Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)
mttr = sum(remediation_time - detection_time) / count(remediated_findings)

# First Response Time
frt = sum(first_action_time - detection_time) / count(findings_with_action)
```

#### Coverage Metrics
```python
# Policy Coverage Rate
policy_coverage = (count(resources_with_policy) / count(total_resources)) * 100

# Scan Coverage Rate
scan_coverage = (count(scanned_resources) / count(scannable_resources)) * 100

# Control Effectiveness
control_effectiveness = (count(controls_preventing_issues) / count(total_controls)) * 100
```

#### Quality Metrics
```python
# False Positive Rate
false_positive_rate = (count(false_positives) / count(total_findings)) * 100

# Finding Accuracy
finding_accuracy = (count(true_positives) / (count(true_positives) + count(false_positives))) * 100

# Validation Success Rate
validation_rate = (count(validated_artifacts) / count(total_artifacts)) * 100
```

    (low_findings * 5)

normalized_risk_score = 100 - min(risk_score, 100)
```
